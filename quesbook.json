For this, the individual must be able to: understand information, retain information, weigh the information and reach a conclusion, and communicate the decision they have reached.\n\nThe consent must be **freely given** (i.e. uncoerced) and the patient must be **suitably informed** (i.e. have been given a suitable level of detail of the procedure, and expected outcomes and risks).\n\nFor an adult, capacity is assumed unless there is reason to doubt; for example the patient has learning difficulties which impacts on their ability to understand and process new information.\n\nValid consent can be received in writing, verbally or tacitly (where it is implied or indicated). A signed consent form does not - by itself - equal 'consent', it is purely *related evidence*.\n\nThe person who should obtain the consent from a patient should be the professional undertaking the procedure, or someone familiar with it, who is able to explain all the necessary information and answer any questions the patient may have."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dcf6e", "topic": "Ethics and Law", "concept": "Valid consent", "explanation": "In order for consent to be valid, doctors need to provide information about the treatment or procedure to ensure that the patient understands enough to be suitably informed and can weigh up the risks and benefits.

She sued for negligence.\nThe surgeon did not routinely warn of risks with a likelihood of less than 1%. The case concluded that because many doctors chose not to warn of this risk because it had a low likelihood (<1%), the doctor had not been negligent.\n\nThe Sidaway case therefore established that a doctor has to provide *enough information* for the patient to reach a *balanced judgement*.

One of these is the law. The law can not only provide details of what *cannot* be done (i.e. what is illegal), it can also set out certain things that have to be done; these are called **legal duties**.\n\nExamples of legal duties include:\n\nA legal duty to breach confidentiality, if: ordered to by a court or judge, a patient is diagnosed with a notifiable disease (notify the local authority), the police request information on a road traffic accident, or grounds are met under the Terrorism Act 2000.\n\nGeneral Practitioners have a legal duty of care to all persons registered on their practice list or anyone who needs help in the practice area.\n\nAny doctor who offers help to someone, where the **help is accepted**, then owes that person a legal duty of care.\n\n\n**LEGAL DEFENCES**\n\nA doctor may have a professional duty (or moral duty) to do something that breaks the law. For example, breaching confidentiality where none of the above conditions are met. In some of these circumstances, a **legal defence** may exist, which allows the doctor to fulfil their professional/moral duty without facing criminal proceedings.\n\n**Legal defences** are established defences for breaking the law, which negate the criminality of the offence. In these situations, the law *allows* the action to the taken, but does not *oblige* it.\n\nFor example, the *public interest defence* is an established legal defence. This means doctors are able to breach confidentiality if they know there is a risk of harm to the public by not doing so, e.g. may have to break confidentiality if a patient with mental illness poses harm to others.\n\nExamples of legal defences:\n\nLegal defence to breach confidentiality if: the public interest defence applies, it relates to serious crime or it relates to serious Sexually Transmitted Diseases\n\nNB: Serious Crime - gunshot and knife wounds have special consideration. Doctors have a duty to inform the police when patients present with these injuries, but what information they choose to disclose is left up to professional decision.

All forms of assisted dying are currently illegal in the UK.\n\n**Euthanasia**, a type of assisted dying, is when the death of another person is *intentionally hastened* for their *own benefit*. The word 'euthanasia' itself means 'good death'. There are different types of euthanasia, but **all forms are illegal in the UK**. There is no legal distinction between euthanasia and murder.\n\n**Active vs Passive Euthanasia**\n\nIn *active* euthanasia, death is hastened by an act. For example, being given a medication to cause death.\nIn *passive* euthanasia, death is hastened by *not doing something* and allowing the person to die. For example, withholding or withdrawing treatment that would prolong life.\n\n**Voluntary, Non-voluntary and Involuntary Euthanasia**\n\n*Voluntary* euthanasia is where someone with capacity makes the decision that they want to hasten their death.\n*Non-voluntary* euthanasia is where someone who lacks the capacity to decide, has their death hastened.\n*Involuntary* euthanasia is where someone who does not want to die has their death hastened. This is not truly a euthanasia; it is murder.\n\nEach of these three types of euthanasia (voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary) can be active or passive.\n\n\n**Assisted Suicide** is where someone (e.g. a spouse, or a doctor) assists the patient to commit suicide. Unlike euthanasia, it is not legally equivalent to murder because the final act is done by the patient themselves. However, it is still illegal in the UK under the Suicide Act 1961 and can result in a sentence of up to 14 years.\n\nAssisted dying is legal in some countries (e.g. Switzerland), and so some people from the UK have been known to travel abroad to end their lives.\n\nIn 2008, Debbie Purdy sought clarification of how the law in the Suicide Act 1961 would be enforced. Debbie Purdy was a woman with multiple sclerosis, who wanted to know if her husband would be prosecuted for assisting her suicide if he helped her travel abroad to end her life. The outcome of the case was that the law was clear that assisting suicide was an offence, and so they could not provide her any reassurance that her husband would not face prosecution.\n\nHowever, the Department of Public Prosecutions later published guidance on what would make a prosecution of assisted suicide in this type of scenario more, or less likely.\n\nFactors that would make a prosecution **less likely** included:\n\n*If the 'suspect' was a spouse, relative, or close friend of the 'victim'*\n\n*If the act was motivated by compassion*\n\n*If the 'victim' had a clear, settled and informed wish to die*\n\n*If the 'victim' had a terminal illness with no hope of cure, or a degenerative condition*\n\nFactors that would make a prosecution **more likely** included:\n\n*If the 'suspect' was a healthcare professional and the 'victim' was in their care*\n\n*If the act was no wholly motivated by compassion*\n\n*If the 'victim' had no clear, settled or informed wish to die*\n\n*If the 'victim' had not asked for help dying under their own initiative*\n\n*If the 'victim' was under 18 years old, or otherwise lacked capacity*\n\n\nAs assisting suicide is illegal under the Suicide Act 1961, there is special guidance about what doctors should do if patients ask about wanting to die. This is important guidance, because doctors need to be careful to stay acting within the law and not be seen to be encouraging or aiding someone to end their own life.\n\nIf a patient asks about wanting to die, the doctor should: listen and explore their reasons, sensitively explain that they are unable to give information about how to hasten death and be alert to depression and pain, taking steps to treat and refer for these issues.\n\nTo offer any more advice or practical help would be in breach of the Suicide Act 1961."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dcf77", "topic": "Ethics and Law", "concept": "Distinguishing between Advanced Statements and Advanced Decisions", "explanation": "**Advanced Care Planning**\n\nThe Mental Capacity Act (MCA) includes provisions that allow people to plan for their care in advance, for a situation in the future where they do not have the capacity to make decisions. Two of these are Advanced Statements and Advanced Decisions. An individual can make both an Advanced Statement and an Advance Decision.\n\n**Advanced Decisions**\n\nAn Advanced Decision, short for Advanced Decision to Refuse Treatment, is a legally binding document. Its purpose is to ensure that an individual can refuse a specific treatment(s) that they do not want to have in the future.\n\nIn order for an Advanced Decision to be legally binding, it must meet certain criteria:\n\n\u200b\t*It must be valid (this means it must have been made at a time when the individual had capacity to make that decision).*\n\n\u200b\t*It must be applicable (this means the wording must be specific to the medical circumstances, and not vague or unclear).*\n\n\u200b\t*It must have been made when the individual was over 18, and fully informed about their decision.*\n\n\u200b\t*It must not have been made under the influence or duress of other people*\n\n\u200b\t*It must be written down, be signed and witnessed (if it concerns a refusal of life-saving treatment)*\n\nTreatments that can be refused include life-sustaining treatments. It cannot refuse basic care (such as washing), food or drink by mouth, measures designed purely for comfort (e.g. painkillers), or treatment for a mental health condition if the individual is sectioned under the Mental Health Act. It can also not demand specific treatment or something that is illegal (e.g. assisted dying).\n\n**Advanced Statements**\n\nAn Advance Statement is sometimes called a \"Statement of Wishes and Care Preferences\". It allows an individual to make general statements about their wishes, beliefs, feelings and values and how these influence their preferences for their future care and treatment.\n\nAn Advance Statement is not by itself legally binding, but legally must be taken into consideration when making a \"best interests\" decision on someone's behalf under the Mental Capacity Act (MCA), 2005. This is because one of the criteria of the MCA is that a patient's \"wishes, feelings, beliefs and values\" must be taken into consideration; an Advanced Statement provides evidence of this.\n\nInformation that can be included in an Advanced Statement can be anything that is important to the individual. This might include:\n\n\u200b\t*Religious or spiritual views, and those that might relate to care*\n\n\u200b\t*Food preferences*\n\n\u200b\t*Information about your daily routine*\n\u200b\t*Where you would like to be cared for (in hospital, at home, in a care home etc.)*\n\n\u200b\t*Any people who you would like to be consulted when best interests decisions are being made on your behalf (however this does not give the same legal power as creating a Lasting Power of Attorney)*\n\nAn Advanced Statement can be made verbally, but it is better to write it down so there is clear documented evidence of an individual's wishes and views.

The MCA is designed to protect vulnerable individuals who lack this capacity, ensuring the decisions made in their care involve them as much as possible and are done in their best interests.\n\nFive key principles underpin the MCA.\n\n1. **Capacity is assumed; it needs to be proven otherwise**\n\n   This means that you must assume that every adult has the capacity to make his or her own decisions, unless proven otherwise. Just because someone has a particular medical condition or disability does not mean you can assume lack of capacity. In this situation, the onus is to prove that this person does not have capacity.\n\n2. **Enabling people to make their own decisions**\n\n   This means that an individual must be helped and supported, as much as possible, to make a decision for themselves. If after all practicable help and support, a lack of capacity is established, it is still important to involve the individual in the decision-making process as much as possible.\n\n3. **Unwise decisions**\n\n   People may make decisions that you consider to be unwise; this does not mean that you can treat them as lacking capacity simply because of this. Every individual will have different priorities, morals, and feelings, and will therefore make different decisions.\n\n4. **Best interests**\n\n   If a person lacks capacity, anything done for them or on their behalf must be done in their best interests.\n\n5. **Less restrictive option**\n\n   If someone without capacity is having a decision made for them, the people making the decision should be careful to ensure they take the least restrictive option, minimising interference with the person's rights and freedom."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dcf7c", "topic": "Ethics and Law", "concept": "Criteria for assessing capacity in adults", "explanation": "There are **four criteria** used when assessing capacity in adults.\n\n1.

A patient with capacity may also refuse CPR.\n\nDoctors can ultimately make the decision to put a DNACPR in place if it is in the patient's *best interests*, even if the patient themselves or their family disagrees. However, following a legal case in 2014, doctors must engage the patient and those close to them on the decision to make a DNACPR, and inform them if the decision to make a DNACPR order has occurred.\n\n**R (Tracey) v Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 2014**\n\nJanet Tracey died in Addenbrooke's Hospital in March 2011.

Patients with two defective copies have have a mild asymptomatic anaemia anaemia \u2013 the so-called alpha thalassaemia trait \u2013 whereas those with three defective copiers have the symptomatic haemoglobin H disease.

These patients develop severe symptomatic anaemia at 3-9 months of age when the levels of foetal haemoglobin fall (which does not contain beta-globin), and its normal replacement with adult haemoglobin fails (made up of two alpha and two beta globin chains).

It is caused by the abnormal clinical proliferation of lymphoid progenitor cells. These lymphoid precursors infiltrate normal haematopoietic cells of the bone marrow and other organs of the body.\n\nCommon presentations include symptoms caused by marrow failure (symptoms of anaemia including fatigue, abnormal bleeding/bruising caused by low platelets, and infections caused by low white cells). Symptoms may also be caused by organ infiltration, such as bone pain. Signs include painless lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, CNS involvement (e.g. cranial nerve palsies, meningism) or testicular infiltration (resulting in painless unilateral testicular enlargement).\n\nBlood results show leukocytosis and blast cells on blood film and bone marrow analysis. \n\nALL is commonly treated with chemotherapy regimens. \n\nWith regards to prognosis, children have a cure rate of 70-90%. \n\n**Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)**\n\nCML is most common in middle-aged patients, with males slightly more affected. It is a myeloproliferative disorder, with overgrowth of granulocytes characteristic of the disease. It is classically associated with the Philadelphia chromosome. \n\nCML usually presents with weight loss, tiredness, fever, and sweating. Common signs include massive splenomegaly (>75%), bleeding (due to thrombocytopenia), and gout. \n\nBlood tests commonly show leukocytosis, in particular raised myeloid cells which include: neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils.

However, patients may present with non-tender lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or B symptoms (weight loss, night sweats, and fever). Features of marrow failure (infection, anaemia, and bleeding) are less common than in the acute leukaemias.\n\nThe most common initial blood result is an incidental lymphocytosis.

Polycythaemia is classified into *relative and absolute causes.*\n\n**Relative polycythaemia**\n\nRelative polycythaemia (or pseudo-polycythaemia) is where there is a falsely elevated haemoglobin secondary to a low plasma volume (remember that haemoglobin is measured as a concentration). This can be seen in dehydration or excess diuretic use. Another common cause of pseudo-polycythaemia is Gaisbock's syndrome, a disorder that is more common in young male adults, particularly smokers, and is associated with hypertension, which reduces plasma volume, hence resulting in the raised haemoglobin.\n\n**Absolute polycythaemia**\n\nIf the plasma volume is normal, the polycythaemia is an absolute polycythaemia (red cell mass will be raised). \n\nAbsolute polycythaemia is classified into primary and secondary causes.\n\nIn primary polycythaemia there is excess erythrocytosis independent of erythropoetin (EPO). \n\nOne example of this is polycythaemia rubra vera (PRV). In PRV the EPO level will therefore be normal or low. \n\nThe condition can be further differentiated from other causes of polycythaemia by the presence of splenomegaly and JAK2 mutation positivity. \n\nThe patient may report fatigue, headache, and visual disturbances (secondary to hyperviscosity).

The abnormal shape of the red blood cells causes clotting of the microcirculation, precipitating a vaso-occlusive crisis leading to ischaemia of vitals organs, and pain.\n\nIn addition, sickle cells commonly sequester in the spleen and undergo phagocytosis by the reticular endothelial system leading to extravascular haemolysis. Commonly this leads to splenic congestion and splenomegaly. The spleen is necessary for phagocytosis of encapsulated bacteria. Consequently, due to a compromised spleen, there is reduced immune function and individuals with sickle cell disease are prone to bacteraemia.\n\n**Clinical features**\n\nPainful vaso occlusive crises are the most common acute presentation of sickle cell anaemia, caused primarily by microvascular obstruction due to cellular sickling, which may be triggered by local hypoxia (e.g. in cold weather).\n\nIn contrast, acute chest crises are the most dangerous acute presentation (3% mortality; cause of 25% of sickle cell related deaths).

There are many diverse causes, both hereditary and acquired. In addition to the distinction between hereditary and acquired causes, haemolytic anaemia can be classified based on the location of the haemolysis: intravascular or extravascular.\n\n**Intravascular haemolytic anaemia**\n\nIntravascular haemolysis occurs in the blood stream, resulting in release of cellular contents (in particular haemoglobin) into the circulation. This excess of haemoglobin is dealt with in many ways: combines with haptoglobin, combines with albumin (methaemalbuminaemia), loss in the urine (haemoglobinuria), and stored in tubular epithelial cells as haemosiderin and shed into the urine (hemosiderinuria).\n\nCauses include: intrinsic cellular injury (glucose-6-phosphate deficiency - G6PD), intravascular complement mediated lysis (some autoimmune haemolytic anaemias, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and acute transfusion reactions), and mechanical injury (MAHA and cardiac valves).\n\nG6PD is an X-linked recessive red-cell enzyme disorder which may present in the neonatal period with jaundice, or later in life with episodic intravascular haemolysis following exposure to oxidative stressors. Triggers include: intercurrent illness or infection (often forgotten), fava beans (the disease was historically known as favism), henna, and medications (primaquine, sulfa-drugs, nitrofurantoin, dapsone, and NSAIDs/Aspirin). The blood film typically shows Heinz bodies and bite cells, and the diagnostic test is a G6PD enzyme assay. Treatment involves avoidance of precipitants, and some patients may rarely require transfusions\n\n**Extravascular haemolytic anaemia**\n\nIn contrast, extravascular haemolysis occurs in the reticuloendothelial system (the spleen and liver) and is therefore not associated with dramatic release of free haemoglobin into the circulation. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly are typical.\n\nCauses include: abnormal red blood cells (sickle cell anaemia and hereditary spherocytosis), and normal cells marked by antibodies for splenic phagocytosis.\n\nHereditary spherocytosis is an autosomal dominant condition, seen in northern European populations, caused by mutations in structural red cell membrane proteins. Abnormal sections of membrane are removed by the spleen, resulting in a reduced surface area to volume ratio and causing spherical distortion of cells (seen as spherocytes on blood film). Eventually, as more membrane is removed, the cells haemolyse (extravascular haemolysis) and are removed from circulation in the spleen. It typically presents with neonatal or childhood onset jaundice/anaemia, and splenomegaly. If mild, patients may be managed conservatively with folic acid supplementation. If severe, splenectomy before the age of 5 years is essentially curative.\n\n**Autoimmune vs non-autoimmune haemolytic anaemia**\n\nHaemolytic anaemia is associated with anaemia and prehepatic jaundice, and may be associated with reticulocytosis, raised LDH and raised urinary urobilinogen.\n\nTo elucidate the aetiology of the haemolytic anaemia, the direct Coombs test may be used. It is a test for autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA).\n\nPatients with AIHA have antibodies directed against cell surface markers on the red blood cell. The Coombs test uses antibodies against these autoantibodies to cross link and agglutinate the red cells.\n\n<u>Coombs-positive haemolytic anaemia</u>\n\nTwo major groups of Coombs-positive AIHA are known: warm and cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.\n\n- Warm AIHA is an IgG mediated extravascular haemolytic disease in which the spleen tags cells for splenic phagocytosis\n- Cold AIHA is an IgM-mediated haemolytic disease in which IgM fixes complement causing direct intravascular haemolysis (also known as cold agglutinins)\n\n*Causes of warm AIHA include:* idiopathic, lymphoproliferative neoplasms (CLL and lymphoma), drugs including methyldopa, and SLE.\n\n*Causes of the cold AIHA include:* idiopathic, and post-infectious haemolytic anaemias (occurring 2-3 weeks after infection with the causative pathogen; examples include EBV and mycoplasma).\n\n<u>Coombs-negative haemolytic anaemia</u>\n\nAcquired haemolytic anaemias that are Coombs negative are a large group of diverse haemolytic disorders.\n\nFirst, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia is an intravascular haemolytic disorder caused by physical lysis of red cells by deposited fibrin strands, resulting in the presence of schistocytes (fragments of red blood cells) on the blood film. It may be isolated, or occur in association with a thrombotic microangiopathy syndrome (such as haemolytic uraemic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura), or in severe cases, disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\nSecond, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria is a rare acquired stem cell disorder of unknown aetiology. An abnormal surface glycoprotein expressed on a subclone of red blood cells marks these cells for complement mediated haemolysis \u2013 severity depends on the size of this subclone. Patients present in early adulthood with nocturnal episodes of intravascular haemolysis (it is not known why this occurs at night), and may be associated with other stem cell defects and increased risk of thrombosis (via an effect on complement mediated platelet aggregation). Diagnosis is with flow cytometry.\n\nThird, physical lysis of red cells may occur in falciparum malaria and babesiosis (diseases in which the parasite grows in the red cell cytoplasm), and in patients with prosthetic heart valves.\n\nFinally, there is a short list of Coombs' negative autoimmune haemolytic anaemias (they make up only 2% of AIHA). \n\n**Infective causes of haemolytic anaemia**\n\nInfective causes of haemolysis are many and vary in terms of mechanism.\n\nFirst, intercurrent infection may cause an exacerbation of an inherited haemolytic disease such as sickle cell anaemia, hereditary spherocytosis and G6PD deficiency.\n\nAcquired causes include:\n\n1. Post-infective cold agglutinins (seen, for example, after EBV and mycoplasma infection)\n2. Coombs negative autoimmune haemolytic anaemia in hepatitis B and C\n3.

A rare cause is the inherited disorder pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase deficiency.\n\nSmall numbers of affected cells may be a normal variant in some patients.\n\n**Howell Jolly Bodies**\n\nHowell Jolly Bodies are remnants of the red blood cell nucleus, typically removed by the spleen.\nTheir presence on a blood film suggests hyposplenism, which can be either functional (with the spleen in situ) or true (associated with splenectomy).\n\n**Schistocytes**\n\nSchistocytes are fragments of red blood cells seen in microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA).\n\nMAHA may be isolated, or associated with thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes (such as haemolytic uraemic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\n\n<u>**Left shift**</u>\n\nThe number of lobes of the neutrophil nucleus can generally be used as an index of neutrophil maturity.\n\nLeft shift describes the presence of immature cells (including so-called band cells - neutrophils with an unlobed, band-shaped nucleus), compared with right shift which describes hypermature neutrophils with >5 nuclear lobes.\n\n- Left shift is primarily seen in acute infection\n- Severe left shift (with the presence of myelocytes, promyelocytes and blasts) is more suggestive of myeloproliferative disorders such as chronic myeloid leukaemia, myelofibrosis or acute leukaemia.\n\n**Leukoerythroblastosis**\n\nA leukoerythroblastic film described to combined presence of immature (including nucleated) red blood cells and left shift (immature white cells).\n\nIt is suggestive of marrow fibrosis or invasion, such as: primary myelofibrosis, metastatic cancer, TB and Gaucher's disease.\n\n**Anisocytosis**\n\nAnisocytosis is variation in red blood cell size, and quantified using the red cell distribution risk.\n\nThe most common cause of anisocytosis with a low mean corpuscular volume is iron deficiency, but may also be caused by sickle cell anaemia, and more rarely by anaemia of chronic disease and thalassaemia (hence the need for confirmatory iron studies in this patient).\n\nIn patients with an elevated mean corpuscular volume and anisocytosis, the differential would include: the megaloblastic anaemias, haemolysis with reticulocytosis, myelodysplasia and liver disease.\n\nIt should also be remembered that a dimorphic anaemia (i.e. anaemia with two underlying causes) may present with a normal mean corpuscular volume and an elevated red cell distribution width.\n\n**Acanthocytosis**\n\nAcanthocytes or spur cells (from the Greek \u201cacantha\u201d, meaning \u201cthorn\u201d) are red blood cells which appears irregularly spiked on a blood film. They are distinct from echinocytes (or burr cells) which are also spiked, but with smaller projections in a more regular distribution than those seen on acanthocytes.\n\nAcanthocytes occur due to altered lipid or protein composition of the red blood cell's plasma membrane. The two most important causes are liver disease and neuroacanthocytosis (including abetalipoproteinemia and homozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinemia); but anorexia nervosa, hypothyroidism and myelodysplasia have also been associated.\n\n<u>**Cabot rings**</u>\n\nCabot Rings are round red blood cell inclusions of unknown origin.

They are distinct from acanthocytes (or spur cells) which appears irregularly spiked or thorny.\n\nEchinocytes are thought to occur due to the extrinsic effect of changes in the composition of a patient's plasma. Causes include: liver disease, vitamin E deficiency, end-stage renal disease, and the haemolytic enzyme disorder pyruvate kinase deficiency.\n\n**Reticulocytosis**\n\nReticulocytes are immature red blood cells. Their presence on a blood film (or full blood count) typically indicates a high turnover of red cells, matched by increased marrow production and release.\n\nExamples of situations where this might occur include haemolysis and acute bleeding.\n\n<u>**Target cells**</u>\n\nTarget cells (also known as codocytes) are a relatively non-specific blood film finding. In contrast to spherocytes, which are thought to occur when the surface areas to volume ratio is reduced, target cells are thought to represent relative membrane excess.\n\nThey are seen in obstructive liver disease, haemoglobinopathies (thalassaemia and sickle cell disease), and post-splenectomy. In addition, small numbers may be seen in iron deficiency anaemia.\n\n<u>**Rouleaux formation**</u>\n\nRouleaux are stacks of aggregated red blood cells.

Decreased marrow haematopoetic function:\n\n- Common causes include chemotherapy and radiotherapy (the pancytopenia may be transient).\n- Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency.\n- Marrow infiltration by haematological malignancies (leukaemias or lymphomas).\n- Myelofibrosis, in which there is progressive marrow fibrosis.\n- Multiple myeloma (a plasma cell dyscrasia).\n- Parvovirus infection in haemolytic disease (such as sickle cell anaemia).\n\n2. Inherited causes of marrow failure: The most common causes include Fanconi's anaemia (an autosomal recessive condition) and dyskeratosis congenita (an X-linked condition).\n\n3. Increased destruction/sequestration of blood cells peripherally. This is seen in conditions affecting the liver (such as hepatitis B/C, autoimmune hepatitis, and cirrhosis).\n\n4. Immune destruction of blood cells. This occurs in drug-induced pancytopenia (secondary to, for example, Sulphonamide or Rifampicin).\n\n5. Combination of causes e.g. autoimmune conditions (such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis) and infective conditions (such as HIV).\n\n**Causes of neutrophilia**\n\nNeutrophilia (high neutrophil count) is generally thought to indicate acute bacterial infection.\n\nThe neutrophil count may also be raised in any state of severe stress (trauma, surgery, necrosis, burns, haemorrhage and seizures), and any state of active inflammation (polyarteritis nodosa, myocardial infarction, and disseminated malignancy).\n\nLess common causes include corticosteroid use (which may also causes lymphopenia) and myeloproliferative disease (chronic myeloid leukaemia).\n\n**Causes of neutropenia**\n\nIsolated neutropenia (low neutrophil count) may be caused by severe sepsis, viral infection, drugs, marrow failure (due to malignancy or infiltration), and other less common conditions (hypersplenism, Felty's syndrome, and SLE).\n\nWhen associated with depleted levels of basophils and eosinophils, neutropenia is known as agranulocytosis. Commonly cited drug causes of agranulocytosis include Carbamazepine, Carbimazole and Clozapine.\n\n**Causes of lymphocytosis**\n\nLymphocytosis describes an increased lymphocyte count.\n\nCommon causes of isolated lymphocytosis include: acute viral infection (especially EBV and CMV), chronic atypical infection (tuberculosis, brucella, toxoplasmosis), and lymphoproliferative disorders (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphoma).\n\n**Causes of eosinophilia**\n\nEosinophilia has a wide and varied differential diagnosis. Simplistically these causes can be divided into four groups: infections, allergy, inflammatory disease and other.\n\n- Parasitic worm infections are the most common cause in patients returning from the tropics (though the absence of eosinophilia does not exclude worms).\n- One cause of particular note is Loeffler's syndrome, an eosinophilic infiltration of the lungs, seen in response to the migration of hookworm, ascaris lumbricoides or strongyloides stercoralis through the pulmonary parenchyma.\n- Allergic phenomena such as atopy and drug reactions (especially erythema multiforme) are another common cause of eosinophilia.\n- Inflammatory diseases, including eosinophilic granulomatosis and polyangiitis (EGPA, previously Churg-Strauss Syndrome) and polyarteritis nodosa have been associated with eosinophilia.\n- Finally, rare and esoteric causes of eosinophilia include eosinophilic leukaemia (and lymphoma), and the hypereosinophilic syndromes.\n\n**Causes of thrombocytopenia**\n\nThrombocytopenia, a low platelet count, can be caused by either *decreased production* (marrow disease or myelosuppressive drugs) or *increased destruction* (immune-regulated, hypersplenism, consumption).\n\nIt should be distinguished from functional thrombocytopenia, in which the platelet count is normal, but platelet pattern bleeding occurs (such as Von Willebrand disease and inherited platelet abnormalities)."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dcfaa", "topic": "Haematology", "concept": "Coagulation cascade", "explanation": "Under normal circumstances, endothelial cells release anti-thrombic chemicals to prevent platelet adhesion and thrombus formation.\n\nDamage to the endothelial cells causes loss in these anti-thrombic chemicals, causing platelets to adhere and block the wound.\n\nIn addition, as the injury occurs, the blood vessels constrict reducing the flow of blood.\n\nFormation of the platelet plug:\n\n1.

Trauma? Anticoagulants/antiplatelets? Relevant past medical history.\n\nDirect compression of the nasal alae (cartilaginous part) is first-line management for epistaxis as most anterior bleeds resolve after 10-15 minutes of compression without interruption. The patient should be sitting up and leaning forward to minimise blood entering the oral cavity and pharynx. A common misconception is that compression of the nasal bones controls bleeding.\n\nIf direct compression of the nasal alae for 10-15 minutes does not resolve epistaxis, the next most appropriate management step in this patient would be nasal cautery as there is a visible bleeding site and this patient also suffers from recurrent epistaxis. He is calm and thus may be able to tolerate cautery.\n\nBefore cautery, a topical anaesthetic spray and vasoconstrictor (lidocaine with phenylephrine) is usually applied to reduce pain and helps control bleeding respectively.\n\nCautery can either be chemical or electrical (thermal). Chemical cautery involves applying 75% silver nitrate sticks to the identified bleeding site for 3-10 seconds. Afterwards the cauterised area is dabbed with a clean cotton bud to remove excess chemical or blood and a topical antiseptic preparation such as Naseptin (chlorhexidine and neomycin) is applied to the nostrils 4 times daily for 10 days to reduce crusting and vestibulitis.\n\nIf nasal cautery fails or there isn't a bleeding point identified or there is severe bleeding, nasal packing would be the next most appropriate management step to tamponade the local bleeding. Nasal tampons, inflatable packs and ribbon gauze impregnated with Vaseline can be used in nasal packing.\n\nAggressive therapies such as nasal balloon catheter and transnasal endoscopy with direct cautery/arterial ligation are reserved for patients with posterior bleeds and uncontrollable severe bleeding unamenable to nasal packing."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dcfea", "topic": "Ear, Nose & Throat", "concept": "Foreign body in the nose", "explanation": "Intranasal foreign bodies occur most commonly in young children.

Just over 10% of recognised pregnancies end in miscarriage, although the total number of miscarriages is higher as many occur without the woman realising she is pregnant.\n\n**Causes:**\n\nThe cause is often idiopathic. Known causes can be split into:\n\n- Foetal pathology\n  - Genetic disorder\n  - Abnormal development\n  - Placental failure\n- Maternal pathology \n  - Uterine abnormality\n  - Cervical incompetence\n  - Polycystic ovary syndrome \n  - Poorly controlled diabetes\n  - Poorly controlled thyroid disease\n  - Anti-p**hospholipid syndrome**\n\n\n**Clinical features:**\n\n- Vaginal bleeding\n- Pain - may be reported to be worse than the pain of a usual period.\n\nThe main other differential for vaginal bleeding before 24 weeks gestation is an ectopic pregnancy. Both can present with pain and vaginal bleeding. In an ectopic pregnancy the pain is often the first and dominant symptom, and if vaginal bleeding does occur it is minor in comparison to a miscarriage.\n\n\n\n**Types of miscarriage:**\n\nThere are several types of miscarriage, these are:\n\n1. Threatened - this is where there are some mild symptoms of bleeding with the foetus retained within the uterus as the cervical os is closed. Hence there is the 'threat' of a miscarriage, but it is not certain. There may be little or no pain. Ultrasound would reveal that the foetus is present intrauterine.\n2. Inevitable - this is where there is often heavy bleeding and pain, where the foetus is currently intrauterine but the cervical os is open. Hence it is inevitable that the foetus will be lost. Ultrasound would reveal that the foetus is present intrauterine.\n3. Complete - there was an intrauterine pregnancy with has now fully miscarried, with all products of conception expelled, and the uterus is now empty. The os is usually closed. The patient may have been alerted to the miscarriage by pain and bleeding.\n4. Missed - the uterus still contains foetal tissue, but the foetus is no longer alive. The miscarriage is 'missed' as often the woman is asymptomatic so does not realise something is wrong. The cervical os is closed.\n\n\n\n**Investigation:**\n\n- A trans-vaginal ultrasound will be used to establish whether there are any foetal components within the uterine cavity and whether a foetal heartbeat can be detected. \n- When these are not present, serial hCG measurements can be used. Serial serum hCG measurements 48 hours apart can help give an indication of the location and prognosis of the pregnancy. \n  - If the levels fall then it is suggested that the foetus will not develop or there has been a miscarriage. \n  - If there is only a slight increase or a plateau in hCG levels then this may indicate an ectopic pregnancy. \n  - A large increase in hCG suggests the foetus is growing normally intrauterine.\n\n\n\n**Management**\n\nMiscarriage often cannot be prevented or stopped. Management therefore revolves around ensuring complete removal of foetal material. \n\nIt can be expectant, medical (misoprostol) or surgical. If managed surgically and the woman is rhesus negative they should receive anti-D prophylaxis.\n\n\n\n**Recurrent miscarriage:**\n\nRecurrent miscarriage is defined as the loss of 3 or more consecutive pregnancies.\n\nInvestigations include blood tests (antiphospholipid antibodies, thrombophilia screen), cytogenetic analysis of products of conception (if abnormal then the parents should be karyotyped), and pelvic ultrasound to identify uterine abnormalities.\n\nThe management is tailored to the contributing pathology:\n\n1. Genetic disorder - refer to a clinical geneticist for genetic counselling. Options include continuing pregnancy attempts with prenatal diagnosis or use of a donor egg/sperm.\n2. Uterine structural abnormality - may be treated surgically. For some congenital uterine malformations there is insufficient evidence to recommend surgical treatment.\n3. Cervical incompetence - regular ultrasound monitoring of the cervix. May use cervical cerclage.\n4. Polycystic ovary syndrome - difficult to manage as pathophysiology is not fully understood. There is no consensus on the most appropriate management. Suppression of the high LH has not been found to be effective.\n5. Antiphospholipid syndrome - heparin and low-dose aspirin\n6.

Its high mortality is linked to the fact that symptoms are often vague until relatively advanced.\n\nThe types of ovarian cancers can be classified according to the cell type from which the cancer originates. The types include:\n\n1. Epithelial ovarian tumours - originate from the epithelium which lines the fimbria of the fallopian tubes or the ovaries. Epithelial tumours are partially cystic, and the cysts can contain fluid. The initial metastatic spread typically involves the peritoneal cavity, with seeding particularly affecting the bladder, paracolic gutters and the diaphragm. Around 90% of ovarian cancers are epithelial ovarian tumours.\n2. Germ cell tumours - originate from the germ cells in the embryonic gonad. These tumours typically grow rapidly and spread predominantly via the lymphatic route. Germ cell tumours most commonly arise in young women, which is atypical for most cases of ovarian cancer. Tumour markers include alpha-fetoprotein and sometimes beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (B-HCG).\n3. Sex cord stromal tumours - originate from connective tissue. They are rare, making up less than 5% of all ovarian tumours. They are malignant tumours, but are much less aggressive than epithelial tumours.\n\nAdditionally, ovarian cancer can be secondary to another cancer elsewhere, which has metastasised to the ovary.

This is the causative organism in 85-90% of cases. Candida infection is associated with pregnancy, antibiotic use and immunosuppression. The method of transmission is generally non-sexual.\n\n- Symptoms in women include: itching, white curdy discharge, sour milk odour, dysuria, superficial dyspareunia\n\n- Examination in women: redness, fissuring, swelling, intertrigo, thick white discharge\n\n- Symptoms in men: soreness, pruritis, redness\n\n- Examination in men: dry, dull, red glazed plaques and papules\n\n**Bacterial Vaginosis**\n\nBacterial Vaginosis is a bacterial overgrowth, leading to vaginal discharge with an associated fishy odour.

The presence of both indicates a de-compensation of chronic liver disease.\n\n\n\n**Investigations:**\n\nInitial investigation should include a thorough clinical investigation looking specifically for icterus, hepatic flap and signs of chronic liver disease such as spider naevi, gynaecomastia and palmar erythema.\n\nInitial blood tests should include:\n\n- INR to look for coagulopathy and establish a diagnosis of liver failure\n- Liver Function Tests including albumin to check liver enzymes, bilirubin      levels and to further assess synthetic function of the liver\n- Full blood count to look for leucocytosis (possible infective cause), thrombocytopaenia (in chronic liver disease) and anaemia (normocytic could indicate haemolytic anaemia as in Wilson's or a GI bleed from oesophageal varices, macrocytic could indicate B12 and folate deficiency as in alcohol excess)\n- Urea and electrolytes to establish baseline renal function and to look for hepato-renal syndrome or any electrolyte abnormalities (such as hypokalaemia which can worsen encephalopathy and should be corrected)\n- Tests to determine cause such as: \n  - Paracetamol level (paracetamoloverdose) \n  - Hepatitis\n  - Epstein-Barr virus\n  - Cytomegalovirus serology (viral infection)\n  - Iron studies (haemochromatosis) \n  - \u03b1-1 anti-trypsin (\u03b1-1 antitrypsin deficiency)\n  - Caeruloplasmin level (Wilson's disease) \n  - Iron studies (hereditary haemochromatosis)\n  - Auto-antibodies (autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis)\n\n- A Doppler ultrasound would be of use in identifying Budd-Chiari syndrome. If ascites is present, a peritoneal tap should be taken for microscopy and culture to look for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.\n\nAbdominal ultrasound may also be indicated.\n\n\n\n**Complications**\n\nThe most common complication of acute liver failure is **infection**.\n\nBacterial infection occurs in up to 80% of patients, and fungal infection in around 30%. This is thought to result from decreased phagocyte action, reduced complement levels and multiple medical interventions which are often invasive. Patients often present atypically, with no fever or raised white cell count.\n\nOther complications include:\n\n- Cerebral oedema \u00b1 raised intracranial pressure\n- Bleeding (where there is a source, for example during the introduction of intracranial pressure monitors)\n- Hypoglycaemia (easily treated with glucose)\n- Multi-organ failure.\n\nIn contrast, major complications of cirrhosis include:\n\n- Ascites\n- Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis\n- Hepatic encephalopathy\n- Portal hypertension\n- Variceal bleeding\n- Hepatorenal syndrome.\n\n\n\n**Management**\n\n- Treat the underlying cause if possible\n- Monitor observations closely including blood glucose\n- For encephalopathy:\n  - Lactulose is given to help nitrogenous waste loss through the bowels (reducing encephalopathy)\n  - IV mannitol can be given to reduce cerebral oedema in encephalopathy\n- For coagulopathy\n  - Vitamin K - helps production of coagulation factors\n  - Fresh frozen plasma can be given if patient is bleeding\n- Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis\n  - Broad spectrum antibiotics\n- Renal dysfunction\n  - May require haemofiltration\n  - If patient required fluid resusitation, human albumin solution rather than crystalloid fluid.\n- Liver transplantation may be necessary - indications are set out below.\n\n**King's College Hospital Criteria for Liver Transplant**\n\nThe King's College Hospital criteria are designed to predict poor outcome in acute liver failure and are therefore an indication of patients that should be considered for urgent liver transplantation. \n\nThe criteria for **paracetamol** induced liver failure are as follows:\n\n* Arterial pH <7.3 24h after ingestion **OR**\n  * Pro-thrombin time >100s\n  * **AND** creatinine >300\u00b5mol/L\n  * **AND** grade III or IV encephalopathy.\n\nThe criteria for non-paracetamol liver failure are as follows:\n\n* Prothrombin time >100s **OR**\n* **Any three of**:\n  * Drug-induced liver failure\n  * Age under 10 or over 40 years\n  * 1 week from 1st jaundice to encephalopathy\n  * Prothrombin time >50s\n  * Bilirubin \u2265300\u00b5mol/L."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd050", "topic": "Gastroenterology", "concept": "Liver Cirrhosis", "explanation": "Cirrhosis is the diffuse fibrosis and structural abnormality of the liver characteristic of chronic liver disease. \n\n\n\n**Clinical features**\n\nThe clinical features of cirrhosis are wide-ranging and should be distinguished from those of liver failure (although the two often co-exist).

If ascites is present, a peritoneal tap should be taken for microscopy and culture to look for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.\n- Transient elastography or acoustic radiation force impulse imaging can be used to diagnose non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n- Liver biopsy may be necessary to confirm the underlying diagnosis.\n\n\n\n**Child-Pugh Score**\n\nThe severity of liver cirrhosis can be estimated by calculating the Child-Pugh score. This scoring system is shown in the table below:\n\n| Score                                  | 1    | 2     | 3      |\n| -------------------------------------- | ---- | ----- | ------ |\n| Bilirubin (umol/l)                     | <34  | 34-51 | >51    |\n| Albumin (g/l)                          | >35  | 28-35 | <28    |\n| Prothrombin time (seconds   prolonged) | <4   | 4-6   | >6     |\n| Encephalopathy                         | none | mild  | marked |\n| Ascites                                | none | mild  | marked |\n\nThe scores are added and the degree of cirrhosis is classified as Child-Pugh A (<7 points), B (7-9 points) or C (>9 points). The score can be used as a predictor of mortality, and may also be used to predict the need for a liver transplant.\n\n\n\n**Complications**\n\nThere are many complications of cirrhosis - it is a serious condition that can affect all other main organ systems and has an overall 5-year mortality of 50%.\n\n* Ascites - this results from portal hypertension and hypoalbuminaemia. It gives rise to other complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.\n* Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) - sudden peritonitis can occur in patients with ascites. It may present atypically (often with no abdominal tenderness or guarding) and should be suspected in patients who deteriorate suddenly with no other obvious cause. An ascitic tap with neutrophils >250mm\u00b3 indicates SBP. Patients with a low ascitic albumin are especially at risk and should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics.\n* Liver failure - with its sequelae of hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy. The former can result in cerebral oedema progressing to raised intracranial pressure and death, and the latter can contribute to life-threatening bleeds in those with a source of bleeding.\n* Hepatocellular carcinoma - patients with cirrhosis are at significantly increased risk, especially those with Hepatitis B and C.\n* Oesophageal varices \u00b1 haemorrhage - the development of portal hypertension in cirrhosis leads to dilatation of oesophageal veins. These are liable to rupture and this can be fatal, especially in patients with coagulopathy.\n* Renal failure - cirrhosis and ascites with renal failure is known as hepatorenal syndrome if other causes of acute kidney injury have been ruled out. Abnormal haemodynamics in liver disease cause renal vasoconstriction which makes the kidneys more susceptible to injury. It has a very poor prognosis.\n\n\n\n**Management of decompensated liver disease**\n\nThere are many sequelae of decompensated liver disease which require careful management by a multi-disciplinary team.\n\n* Good nutrition is essential, with total alcohol abstinence.\n* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sedatives and opiates should all be avoided.\n* An ultrasound scan and serum \u03b1-fetoprotein every 6 months may be indicated to detect development of hepatocellular carcinoma.\n* Colestyramine (bile acid sequestrant) can beused to manage pruritus.\n* Ascites can be managed with fluid restriction (under 1.5L per day) and a low-salt diet. Pharmacological management is with spironolactone; furosemide can be added if necessary. In severe cases, therapeutic paracentesis can be used alongside albumin infusions.\n* Recurrent episodes of encephalopathy can be reduced in frequency through the use of prophylactic lactulose and rifaximin.\n* Patients at high-risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (such as those who have had previous episodes, or those with low albumin, a high INR and low ascitic albumin) may be treated with prophylactic antibiotics.\n* Ultimate treatment is a liver transplant. For cases of chronic liver disease scores such as the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and UK End-stage Liver Disease (UKELD) are used to help predict severity of disease.\n  * Note that the King's College Criteria are not generally used for chronic cases and instead are used in acute (or acute-on-chronic) liver failure where a decision needs to be made rapidly."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd051", "topic": "Gastroenterology", "concept": "Ulcerative Colitis", "explanation": "Ulcerative colitis is a chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory granulomatous disease affecting the large bowel.

If remission is not achieved within 4 weeks, consider adding an oral aminosalicylate.\n\n- **Proctitis and proctosigmoiditis:** \n  - Step 1: Topical ASA or oral ASA.\n  - Step 2: Consider adding oral prednisolone. If this does not help after 2-4 weeks or symptoms worsen, consider adding oral tacrolimus.\n- **Left sided or extensive disease**\n  - Step 1: High dose oral ASA.\n  - Step 2: Consider adding oral prednisolone. If this does not help after 2-4 weeks or symptoms worsen, consider adding oral tacrolimus.\n\n*Acute severe disease*\n\n- Step 1: IV corticosteroids (if contraindicated or not tolerated, use IV ciclosporin).\n- Step 2: If no improvement in 72 hours or worsening symptoms, add IV ciclosporin or consider surgery (if IV ciclosporin contraindicated or not tolerated, consider infliximab).\n- Indications for emergency surgery:\n  - Surgery should be considered in patients with:\n    - Acute fulminant ulcerative colitis\n    - Toxic megacolon who have little improvement after 48-72 hours of intravenous steroids \n    - Symptoms worsening despite intravenous steroids\n\n*Note that an alternative is to initiate rescue therapy (with ciclosporin or infliximab) if the patient has a sub-optimal response to intravenous steroids but is stable enough to delay surgery. Surgery should be considered if patients fail to respond to rescue therapy within 3 days.*\n\n- Surgical options include: \n  - Panproctocolectomy with permanent end ilesotomy\n  - Colectomy with temporary end ileostomy (approximately 3 months later the ileostomy can be reversed by forming an ileorectal anastomosis, an alternative option is completion proctectomy with a permanent end ileostomy or ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA)).\n\n\n\nIndications for elective surgery:\n\n- This can be considered in patients in which there is failure to induce remission by medical means.\n- Surgical options include: panproctocolectomy with permanent end ileostomy or IPAA. An alternative is a total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (i.e. no stoma).\n\n \n\n**Complications**\n\nShort-term/acute complications:\n\n- Toxic megacolon: this describes a severe form of colitis, and is seen in around 15% of ulcerative colitis patients.\n- Massive lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage: this occurs in up to 3% of patients.\n\n\n\nLong-term complications:\n\n- Colorectal cancer: this occurs in 3-5% of patients. There is a higher risk with disease duration, severity and extent of colitis, and concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). \n\n*NICE guidance suggests offering colonoscopy surveillance to high risk patients.* \n\n- Cholangiocarcinoma: ulcerative colitis approximately doubles the      risk of cholangiocarcinoma.\n- Strictures: these can cause large bowel obstruction.\n\n\n\nVariable-term complications:\n\n- PSC: this is characterised by inflammation and fibrosis of the extra- and intra-hepatic biliary tree and affects 3-7% of patients with ulcerative colitis.

There may be abdominal/right lower quadrant tenderness and a right iliac fossa mass.\n- PR examination should be carried out to check for perianal skin tags, fistulae, or perianal abscess.\n\n**Extra-intestinal manifestations include:**\n\n- Dermatological manifestations: \n  - Erythema nodosum (painful erythematous nodules/plaques on the shins)\n  - Pyoderma gangrenosum (a well-defined ulcer with a purple overhanging edge)\n- Ocular manifestations: \n  - Anterior uveitis (painful red eye with blurred vision and photophobia)\n  - Episcleritis (painless red eye).\n- Musculoskeletal manifestations: \n  - Arthritis (typically asymmetrical and non-deforming)\n  - Sacro-iliitis (similar to Ankylosis spondylitis).\n- Hepatobiliary manifestations: \n  - Gallstones (these are more common in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis)\n- Other features include AA amyloidosis (secondary to chronic inflammation) and renal stones (these are more common in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis)\n\n\n\n**Investigations in Crohn's disease**\n\n- Blood tests:\n  - Raised white cell count\n  - Raised ESR/CRP\n  - Thrombocytosis\n  - Anaemia (secondary to chronic inflammation)\n  - Low albumin (secondary to malabsorption)\n\n- Stool culture is necessary to exclude infection.\n- **Faecal calprotectin** (an antigen produced by neutrophils) will be raised (this helps distinguish inflammatory bowel disease from irritable bowel syndrome).\n\n- Endoscopy with imaging is required for diagnosis. Colonoscopy with biospy will reveal: \n  - Intermittent inflammation ('skip lesions')\n  - Cobblestone mucosa (due to ulceration and mural oedema)\n  - Rose-thorn ulcers (due to transmural inflammation), \u00b1 fistulae or abscesses. \n  - Non-caseating granulomas\n- MRI is required for suspected small bowel disease.\n- Note that wireless capsule endoscopy and upper/lower GI series (small bowel follow-through/barium enema) may reveal macroscopic pathology consistent with Crohn's disease, but tissue biopsy is typically required for diagnosis.\n- Upper GI series may show the 'string sign of Kantour'. This is used to describe the string-like appearance of contrast-filled narrowed terminal ileum, and is suggestive of Crohn's disease.\n\n\n\n**Management**\n\nMedical management to induce remission:\n\n- Patients should be offered monotherapy with glucocorticoids (prednisolone or IV hydrocortisone).\n- Enteral nutrition may be considered as an alternative in children (as steroids suppress growth).\n- Azathioprine or mercaptopurine may be added on to induce remission if there are 2 or more exacerbations in a 12-month period or the glucocorticoid cannot be tapered.\n  - It is important to assess for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity before offering azathioprine or mercaptopurine.\n\n*Methotrexate may be considered as add-on therapy in patients who do not tolerate azathioprine or mercaptopurine or who are TPMT deficient.*\n\n- Biological agents (such as infliximab or adalimumab) are recommended in patients with severe Crohn's disease who fail to respond to the above.\n\n\n\nMedical management to maintain remission:\n\n- Azathioprine or mercaptopurine should be offered 1st line.\n- Methotrexate may be considered in patients who are intolerant/have a contraindication to azathioprine or mercaptopurine or who do not respond to azathioprine or mercaptopurine monotherapy.\n\n\n\nSurgical management is rarely curative in Crohn's disease (unlike in ulcerative colitis) so should be maximally conservative.\n\n*Management of peri-anal fistulae:*\n\n- Drainage seton is the management of choice for high (trans-sphincteric) fistulae. A seton is a thread passed through the fistula tract, forming a ring between the internal and external openings. It is used in the management of high trans-sphincteric fistulae, to prevent division of the anal sphincter muscles and incontinence. Closure of the fistula occurs by the formation of granulation tissue.\n- Fistulotomy is the management of choice for low (submucosal) fistulae. Fistulotomy involves dissecting the superficial tissue and opening the fistula tract. This is not a treatment option for high fistulae due to the risk of incontinence.\n- 'Sphincter saving' methods include fibrin glue and fistula plug - these are still under investigation and have not yet been approved in mainstream management.\n\n*Management of peri-anal abscess:*\n\n- The patient should be started on intravenous antibiotics e.g. ceftriaxone + metronidazole.\n- Patients typically require examination under anaesthetic and incision and drainage. An incision is made in the affected region, the pus is broken up, the infected tissue material is excised, and anti-septic soaked packes are inserted.

Some patients may produce frothy sputum. \n\nThey may also have signs of fluid overload, which include: raised JVP, S3 gallop and peripheral oedema.\n\nPrecipitants of pulmonary oedema may include cardiac ischaemia, arrhythmias or non-compliance with regular heart failure medication.\n\nAcute pulmonary oedema should be diagnosed clinically. \nFurther investigations that can be ordered include a CXR, serum BNP, ECG and cardiac markers.\n\nThe treatment of acute pulmonary oedema includes oxygen, IV furosemide and or nitrates. The patient should also be sat upright to help with breathing.\n\nFailing medical therapy, non-invasive ventilation such as CPAP can be used. Any underlying precipitants of an acute pulmonary oedema must also be managed accordingly.\n\nNitrates should be avoided in hypotensive patients. Recent studies have shown that the use of Morphine is associated with poorer outcomes. It should only be reserved for patients with severe anxiety and respiratory distress. \n\n**Managing patients with heart failure and renal impairment**\n\nManaging a patient who has both heart failure and renal impairment is a difficult situation. \n\nAcute Kidney Injury (AKI) is largely pre-renal due to under-perfusion, which is usually managed by replacing fluid as patient are often hypovolaemic.\n\nHowever, in the case of heart failure and AKI, the under-perfusion is due to the poor output from the heart.\n\n The Starling curve demonstrates that when the left ventricle end-diastolic volume is too high the stroke volume falls. This is the case in heart failure patients with fluid overload.\n\nTherefore, by off-loading fluid with diuresis, the stroke volume improves, there is greater output from the heart, and so perfusion to the kidneys improve. Overall, when there is elevated central venous pressure, the renal function may recover with the aid of diuresis.\n\n**Management of heart failure with hypotension**\n\nManaging overloaded heart failure patients who are hypotensive is a difficult situation. The use of diuretics carries the risk of further lowering the blood pressure, which can severely impact upon perfusion of the vital organs.\n\nIn patients with heart failure with low LV ejection fraction, if the systolic blood pressure is low (<85mmHg) or the patient is shocked (e.g. confusion, cool extremities) then addition of an inotrope may be indicated on further discussion with a senior colleague and/or intensive care specialist. In the interim, small fluid challenges of 250ml boluses over 15-20 minutes may be appropriate to keep the blood pressure above 90mmHg but this needs to be carefully titrated.\n\nVasopressors (e.g. noradrenaline) may play a role in patients with heart failure with persistent hypotension, alongside evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. However, their use is normally only after there has been insufficient response to inotropes.\n\nThese measures are only temporary and aim to maintain perfusion to the end-organs until the acute trigger for the deterioration has been reversed, or a definitive therapy (e.g. coronary revascularisation, mechanical circulatory support, or heart transplantation) has been employed."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd093", "topic": "Emergencies", "concept": "Emergency Management of Cardiac Tamponade", "explanation": "Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition characterised by an accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac.

It may also be prominent at night. If the ulcer is on the posterior wall it may cause the pain to radiate through to the back. The patient often has epigastric tenderness. \n\nOther than different anatomical locations on visualisation, gastric and duodenal ulcers are difficult to differentiate clinically. Some sources state that in gastric ulcers the pain is worse soon after eating (due to acid secretion), while duodenal ulcers the pain is worse several hours after eating (when the pyloric sphincter relaxes to allow the acidic food contents into the duodenum). However, this is non-specific and literature analyses have demonstrated that the two cannot be distinguished from clinical features alone.\n\nInvestigations may be done to look for Helicobacter Pylori infection. Ultimately, diagnosis can be confirmed using oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD).\n\n**Varices**\n\nThe causes of portal hypertension can be broadly divided into pre-hepatic, hepatic, and post-hepatic causes. Pre-hepatic causes are due to obstruction of the portal vein (e.g. portal vein thrombosis, extrinsic pressure from tumour). Hepatic causes include cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, and schistosomiasis. Post-hepatic causes are due to obstruction of hepatic veins or venules (e.g. Budd-Chiari syndrome, right heart failure). Overall, the most common cause is cirrhosis. \n\nAs the portal pressure rises, the pressure difference between the portal and systemic circulation increases. This leads to blood being forced down the pressure gradient via portosystemic collaterals. Up to 90% of the portal flow may be diverted through this way. When these collaterals are located at the gastro-oesophageal junction and oesophagus they are called varices. \n\nThe flow through gastro-oesophageal varices is delivered by the left gastric vein and the short gastric veins at the splenic hilum. \n\nAs the pressure gradient increases, the varices engorge and the vessel wall thickness diminishes. Ultimately, rupture occurs when the pressure exceeds the elastic limit of the vessel wall. The most common place of rupture is the gastro-oesophageal junction as these varices tend to have the thinnest wall. \n\nCollaterals can also occur elsewhere. Occurring via the umbilical vein leads to caput medusae radiating from the umbilicus. Caput medusae is the term used to describe the distended and engorged paraumbilical veins, which have been said to have apparent similarity to Medusa's head, with snakes instead of hair. Collaterals can occur at the anorectal junction, which can rarely lead to rectal bleeding.\n\nVariceal bleeding occurs from dilated vessels between the portal and systemic circulation systems secondary to portal hypertension. A common site is at the gastro-oesophageal junction. Variceal bleeding is responsible for 5-10% of upper GI bleeds. \n\nVariceal bleeding presents with features of an upper GI bleed. These may include haematemesis, abdominal pain, and malaena. There may be factors indicating portal hypertension, such as features of liver disease. If the bleeding is heavy, there may be tachycardia and hypotension, suggesting a hypovolaemic state. \n\nThe upper GI bleed can be scored using the Glasgow-Blatchford score. Investigations should include routine bloods as well as clotting and a group and save or cross-match. With significant bleeding, endoscopy is often required at an early stage. \n\n\nTerlipressin is used in suspected variceal bleeding, which acts as a vasopressin analogue. It should be stopped after haemostasis or after five days. Prophylactic antibiotics should also be given in suspected variceal bleeding. Endoscopic haemostatic measures for bleeding varices include band ligation and injection of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. The formation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) should be considered if these fail to control the bleeding.\n\n\n**Upper GI bleed scores**\n\nThere are two scoring systems which can be implemented in patients suffering from an upper GI bleed. \n\nThe Glasgow-Blatchford score is used prior to endoscopy. It is used to categorise patients into risk groups. If the score is 0 then it predicts that there is a low chance that the patient will require any 'medical intervention'. Any score greater than 0  suggests a high risk GI bleed that is likely to require medical intervention. This medical intervention may take the form of transfusion, endoscopy, or surgery. \n\nThe Glasgow-Blatchford score:\n\n| Criteria                           | Points                                      | \n| ------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------:|\n| Anaemia                        | 1-6 depending on severity       | \n| Urea                              | 1- 6 depending on severity       |   \n| BP                                 | 1-3 depending on hypotension |    \n| Tachycardia                  | 1                                               |\n| Melaena                        | 1                                               |\n| Recent syncope            | 2                                               |\n| Hepatic disease history | 2                                              |\n| Cardiac failure               | 2                                              |\n\nThe Rockall score can be used in patients who have undergone endoscopy. As well as signs of shock and background factors of age and co-morbidities, it includes the diagnosis from endoscopy and whether there were any visible stigmata of recent haemorrhage. The score can be used to estimate the risk of re-bleeding and the risk of mortality.\n\n**Management of non-variceal bleeding**\n\nTreatment of any upper GI bleed is as follows:\n\n* ABCDE assessment\n* Insert 2 large bore IV cannulae and take bloods for FBC, U+E, LFT, clotting, cross match\n* IV fluids - fluid challenge if hypotensive\n* Catheterise\n* Correct clotting if needed\n* Urgent endoscopy\n\n\nThe upper GI bleed can be scored using the Glasgow-Blatchford score. Investigations should include routine bloods as well as clotting and a group and save or cross-match. With significant bleeding, endoscopy is often required at an early stage. \n\nEndoscopy is the method of choice for managing bleeding from a peptic ulcer. Therapeutic measures include clipping, thermal coagulation, fibrin, or thrombin. Injection of adrenaline should not be used as monotherapy, but can be given alongside any of the aforementioned techniques. \n\nEndoscopic treatment should only be used if there are active bleeding lesions, non-bleeding visible vessels, or ulcers with an adherent blood clot. Ulcers which are just oozing rarely require endoscopic treatment as they have a good prognosis without intervention. \n\nInterventional radiology should be considered for unstable patients who re-bleed after initial endoscopic treatment. Percutaneous angiography can be used to identify the point of bleeding, which can be followed by the embolisation of respective vessel.\n\nDrugs for acid suppression should not be offered prior to endoscopy in patients where non-variceal bleed is suspected. Proton pump inhibitors should be given post-endoscopy when non-variceal upper GI bleed and evidence of recent bleeding has been found at endoscopy.\n\n**Management of acute variceal bleeding**\n\nTreatment of any upper GI bleed is as follows:\n\n* ABCDE assessment\n* Insert 2 large bore IV cannulae and take bloods for FBC, U+E, LFT, clotting, cross match\n* IV fluids - fluid challenge if hypotensive\n* Catheterise\n* Correct clotting if needed\n* Urgent endoscopy\n\n\nVariceal bleeding occurs from dilated vessels between the portal and systemic circulation systems secondary to portal hypertension.

Schizophrenia development is multi-factorial, however, there are a number of identifiable risk factors:\n\n*Family history*\n\nA positive family history increases the risk of developing\nschizophrenia. The more closely related the two individuals are, the\ngreater the increase in risk. For example:\n\n* 2% risk with an affected first cousin\n* 5% risk with an affected grandparent, aunt/uncle, niece/nephew\n* 10% risk if either a parent or sibling is affected\n* 50% if both parents are affected or an identical twin is affected\n\n*Environmental risk factors*\n\n* Traumatic events in childhood (e.g. poor maternal affection and bonding, poverty, exposure to natural disasters)\n* Heavy cannabis use in childhood\n* Maternal poor health (including malnutrition and infections such as rubella and cytomegalovirus)\n* Birth trauma (hypoxia and blood loss in particular)\n* Living in the city\n* Living in/emigrating to more developed countries\n\n**Features**\n\nThe first rank features of schizophrenia can be divided into auditory hallucination, thought disorders, delusional perceptions and passivity phenomena.\n\n- Auditory hallucinations are classically a third person running commentary. There can also be thought echo or command hallucinations.\n- Thought disorders include: thought insertion (thoughts implanted into the patient), thought withdrawal (thoughts being removed from the patient) and thought broadcasting ('others can hear my thoughts').\n- Delusional perceptions are a 2 stage process where a normal object is perceived and secondly there is a delusional insight into its meanin e.g. \"I saw the Queen on the television and I knew that the mafia would be set to murder me\".\n- Passivity phenomena describes the sensation of an external influence controlling the thoughts or actions of the sufferer.\n\nSchizophrenia sufferers also display a number of **negative symptoms**. These include:\n\n* Alogia (poverty of speech)\n* Anhedonia (inability to derive pleasure)\n* Incongruity/blunting of affect\n* Avolition (poor motivation)\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe ICD-10 diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia requires at least one symptom of:\n\n* Thought echo, insertion, withdrawal or broadcasting\n* Delusions of control, influence or passivity\n* Hallucinatory voices giving a running commentary on the patient's behaviour, or discussing the patient among themselves\n* Persistent delusions of other kinds that are culturally inappropriate and completely impossible\n\nor at least two symptoms of:\n* Persistent hallucinations in any modality, when accompanied by fleeting delusions or over-valued ideas\n* Breaks in the train of thought\n* Catatonic behaviour\n* 'Negative' symptoms such as marked apathy, paucity of speech and blunting or incongruity of emotional responses\n* Significant and consistent change in the overall quality of personal behaviour\n\nThese symptoms should have been present for most of the time during a period of at least one month.\n\n**Investigations in schizophrenia**\n\nSchizophrenia is a clinical diagnosis based on diagnostic criteria, however there are a number of tests that can be considered based on the history and examination:\n\n* CT/MRI head\n* HIV and syphilis screen\n* Drug testing\n* Routine bloods including FBC and TFTs\n\n**Prognosis in Schizophrenia**\n\nThere are a number of prognostic indicators in schizophrenia. The following are factors associated with a better prognosis:\n\n* High IQ/education level\n* Sudden onset\n* Obvious precipitating factor such as a traumatic life event\n* A strong support network\n* Positive symptoms predominant\n\nGenerally speaking, the prognosis of schizophrenia can be thought of as \"the rule of quarters\". 25% never have another episode, 25% improve substantially on treatment, 25% have some improvement and 25% are resistant to treatment.\n\n**Differentials of schizophrenia** \n\nThere are a number of conditions that can mimic schizophrenia:\n\n* Substance induced psychotic disorder (commonly drugs of abuse, but can\nbe iatrogenic e.g. steroids)\n* Organic psychosis caused by infection, brain injury and CNS diseases\nsuch as Wilson's disease\n* Metabolic disorder such as hyperthyroidism and hyperparathyroidism\n* Dementia and depression can also co-occur with psychosis\n\n**Treatment** \n\nParanoid schizophrenia, as with any psychotic disorder, is treated first-line with atypical antipsychotics such as Risperidone. These are preferred to typical antipsychotics such as Haloperidol, due to the reduced risk of extra-pyramidal symptoms.\n\nSedative drugs such as Lorazepam may be used if there is acute behavioural disturbance in the presentation of paranoid schizophrenia, but this is not the first-line treatment and will not improve psychotic symptoms.\n\nNICE recommends **Clozapine** for children and young people whose schizophrenia has not responded to adequate doses of at least two different antipsychotics used sequentially for 6-8 weeks."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd0cc", "topic": "Psychiatry", "concept": "Dementia with Lewy bodies", "explanation": "* Accounts for around 20% of cases of dementia\n* Characterised by alpha-synuclein cytoplasmic inclusions (Lewy bodies)\nin the substantia nigra, paralimbic and neocortical areas.\n* Associated with Parkinson's disease - patients are also highly sensitive to neuroleptics, which causes a deterioration in parkinsonism\n* Three core features: fluctuating cognition, parkinsonism and visual hallucinations\n* Progressive cognitive impairment seen\n* Diagnosis is usually clinical but dopamine uptake scanning may be used"}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd0cd", "topic": "Psychiatry", "concept": "Frontotemporal dementia", "explanation": "* Caused by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes\n* Classically presents at a younger age than other forms of dementia\n* Patients exhibit early personality change and frequently become\ndisinhibited\n* Language can also be affected early on\n* Often misdiagnosed, and neuroimaging may need to be used.

A 'manic switch' can sometimes be induced by someone with Bipolar Affective Disorder taking antidepressants to treat a depressive episode.\n\nDuring periods of depression the patient may become withdrawn and tearful, with low mood, poor sleep and anhedonia. They may experience suicidal thoughts or make attempts.\n\nManic episodes are characterised by elevated mood or irritability. They may make impulsive and dangerous decisions with little thought for consequences. The need for sleep is often reduced. Mood congruent delusions may be present.

The management of these are as follows:\n\n**Acute mania with agitation:** patients will typically require IM therapy, either a neuroleptic or a benzodiazepine. They may need urgent admission to a secure unit.\n\n**Acute mania without agitation:** oral monotherapy can be attempted with an antipsychotic. Sedation and a mood stabilizer such as lithium can be added if necessary.\n\n**Acute depression:** mood stabilizer and/or atypical antipsychotic and/or antidepressant with appropriate psychosocial support.\n\nAll of these patients will require long-term follow up and maintenance therapy.\n\n**Management of BPAD \u2013 Chronic**\n\nPatients with bipolar disorder are at high risk of relapse into either depression or mania. As such, they require careful follow-up and ongoing maintenance treatment.\n\nLithium is the gold standard medication for bipolar disorder and acts as a mood stabiliser. Valproate is a suitable second line alternative. Anti-psychotics and anti-convulsants may also be used in treatment resistant cases.\n\nAdditionally, NICE recommends that all patients with bipolar disorder have access to psychological therapies.

There must be clear concerns from the individual regarding their weight and shape, with a fear of becoming fat as an intrusive overvalued idea. Patients may have weight or calorie goals in mind and are often determined to achieve this no matter what, and regardless of the impact on their physical health.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind weight control by other compensatory measures, such as excessive exercise, laxative use, or vomiting.\n\nAnorexia Nervosa is not attributable to a single causative factor. It often results from complex biological, psychological and social problems, but known predisposing or precipitating factors include dieting, maternal encouragement of weight loss, family history of eating disorders, adolescent period, personal history of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders or obsessive-compulsive disorders, perfectionist traits, and at-risk professions such as sportspeople, dancers or models.\n\n\nPhysical features seen in anorexia nervosa include:\n\n* Low BMI\n* Hypotension\n* Bradycardia\n* Enlarged salivary glands\n* Lanugo hair (fine hair covering the skin)\n* Amennorhea\n\nTypical biochemistry results include:\n\n* Hypokalaemia\n* Low sex hormone levels (FSH, LH, oestrogen and testosterone)\n* Raised growth hormone and cortisol levels\n* Hypercholesterolaemia\n\nPatients have a pre-occupation with food and calories, often starving themselves or purging via vomiting, laxatives or excessive exercise. Insight is often poor.\n\n\n**Treatment of anorexia nervosa**\n\nTreatment involves aiming to return to a healthy weight and using psychological therapies to treat the underlying thought processes.\n\nIf nutritional intake is resumed too rapidly after a period of relatively low caloric intake, the patient is at high risk of refeeding syndrome. Rapidly increasing insulin levels lead to shifts of potassium, magnesium and phosphate from extracellular to intracellular spaces. This is potentially fatal if refeeding is too rapid.\n\nSymptoms of refeeding syndrome may include oedema, confusion and tachycardia. Blood tests initially show hypophosphataemia and it is treated with phosphate supplementation.\n\nBecause of the resulting malnutrition, those with Anorexia Nervosa are predisposed to cardiac arrhythmias.  An ECG should always be performed in those admitted to hospital with Anorexia Nervosa, in outpatient treatment or in those with symptoms such as dizziness, fainting or light-headedness. In the body's attempts to reduce energy expenditure with minimal calorie intake, bradycardia and hypotension are commonly seen, as well as a prolonged QT interval.

DSM-5 uses the following diagnostic criteria:\n\n1. **Depressed mood or irritable most of the day**, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful).\n2. **Decreased interest or pleasure** (anhedonia) in most activities, most of each day\n3.

Additionally, long standing infections such as mononucleosis\n- Neoplasms and cancers - pancreatic cancer is a notable example. However, low mood can theoretically be a presenting complaint in any cancer. It may be as a result of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune system modulation.\n \n\n\n\n**Initial management of depression**\n\nNICE guidelines suggest a stepped care model for the treatment of depression, depending on the severity of the presentation, comorbidity with chronic physical health problems or personal preference. \n\nFirst-line, low intensity psychological interventions or group-based CBT may be offered, before moving on to either pharmacological therapy or a high intensity psychological intervention such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or Interpersonal Therapy. For those with moderate or severe depressive episodes, psychological therapies may be offered in conjunction with medication.\n\nPharmacological therapy should start with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, such as Sertraline. \n\nPatients who have benefitted from antidepressants should be continued for at least six months **after remission** to reduce the risk of relapse. When stopping antidepressants, doses should be reduced gradually over a four week period.\n\nUrgent referral may be necessary if a patient is actively suicidal. It is therefore essential to screen for this during the initial consultation. \n\n\n**Management of severe depression**\n\n\nSevere depressive episodes can be managed in a number of ways, one of which will usually include pharmacological therapy. Antidepressants should be initiated in a typical step-wise manner, one of which should be a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, such as Sertraline. Psychological therapy should be offered in combination with pharmacological therapy. \n\nIf antidepressants alone do not work, they can be augmented with Lithium. \n\nFor severe depressive episodes that are life-threatening or require a rapid response, NICE guidelines recommend Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT).\n\nIt is not known exactly how ECT works but there is evidence to suggest that the induced seizure has more of a treatment effect than 'placebo' ECT or 'sham' ECT. Short-term side effects of ECT can include headache, muscle aches or pains, nausea, temporary memory loss, confusion. \n\nLong-term side effects of ECT can include persistent memory loss. \n\nDue to the induced seizure, there is a risk of damage to the teeth or mouth, and due to the general anaesthetic, there is a small risk of death."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd0e1", "topic": "Psychiatry", "concept": "Lithium toxicity", "explanation": "Lithium has a range of side effects, but it is important to differentiate those seen at a therapeutic dose vs those that indicate lithium toxicity.\n\nSide effects seen at a therapeutic dose include:\n\n* Fine tremor\n* Dry mouth\n* GI disturbance\n* Increased thirst\n* Increased urination\n* Drowsiness\n* Thyroid dysfunction\n\nSide effects that indicate toxicity, and therefore require immediate\nassessment include:\n\n* Coarse tremor\n* CNS disturbance including seizures, impaired co-ordination, dysarthria\n* Arrhythmias\n* Visual disturbance\n\nThe management of lithium toxicity is largely supportive and requires specialist input.

Headaches last 15 minutes to 3 hours, occur once or twice a day, over a period of 4-12 weeks, and are followed by a pain-free period of months before the next cluster begins.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Clinical, based on the history.\n\n**Treatment**: **Avoid triggers**; **prophylaxis** with Verapamil; **managing an acute attack** with 100% oxygen via non-rebreathable mask (CI: COPD) with a subcutaneous or nasal Triptan (CI: ischaemic heart disease).\n\n\n\n**Tension headaches** \n\n**Symptoms:** Bilateral, non-pulsatile headaches. They feel tight, like a band around the head. They may be associated with tenderness of the scalp muscles, as their contraction is the primary source of the pain.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Clinical, based on the history.\n\n**Treatment:** Analgesia as per the WHO pain ladder; usually Paracetamol or an NSAID will control the pain.

Haemorrhagic stroke occurs when there is rupture of a cerebrospinal artery.\n\n**Stroke classification (Bamford/Oxford classification)**\n\nA total anterior circulation infarct (TACI) is defined by:\n\n-\tContralateral hemiplegia or hemiparesis, AND\n-\tContralateral homonymous hemianopia, AND\n-\tHigher cerebral dysfunction (e.g. aphasia, neglect)\nA TACI involves the anterior AND middle cerebral arteries on the affected side.\n\nA partial anterior circulation infarct (PACI) is defined by:\n\n-\t2 of the above, OR\n-\tHigher cerebral dysfunction alone.\n-\tA PACI involves the anterior OR middle cerebral artery on the affected side.\n\nA lacunar infarct (LACI) is defined by: a pure motor stroke, pure sensory stroke, sensorimotor stroke, or ataxic hemiparesis.\nThere should be NO: visual field defect, higher cerebral dysfunction, or brainstem dysfunction.\nA LACI affects small deep perforating arteries, typically supplying internal capsule or thalamus.\n\nA posterior circulation infarct (POCI) is defined by:\n\n-\tCerebellar dysfunction, OR\n-\tConjugate eye movement disorder, OR\n-\tBilateral motor/sensory deficit, OR\n-\tIpsilateral cranial nerve palsy with contralateral motor/sensory deficit, OR\n-\tCortical blidness/isolated hemianopia.\n\nA POCI involves the vertebrobasilar arteries and associated branches (supplying the cerebellum, brainstem, and occipital lobe).\n\n**Posterior Stroke Syndromes**\n\nThere are a number of different posterior stroke syndromes  that you should be aware of.\n\n- Basilar artery occlusion is more likely to present with locked in syndrome (quadriparesis with preserved consciousness and ocular movements), loss of consciousness, or sudden death.\n\n- Anterior inferior cerebellar artery results in lateral pontine syndrome, a condition similar to the lateral medullary syndrome but with additional involvement of pontine cranial nerve nuclei.\n\n- Wallenberg's syndrome syndrome (lateral medullary syndrome) causes ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, ipsilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation on the face, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation over the contralateral body.\n- Weber's syndrome/medial midbrain syndrome (paramedian branches of the upper basilar and proximal posterior cerebral arteries): causes an ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis.\n\n\n**Acute management of ischaemic stroke**\n\nPatients should be approached in the DR ABCDE manner.\n\nAirway protection (in patients presenting with depressed consciousness) and aspiration precautions (in patients presenting with swallowing impairment) are very important.\n\nSubsequent stroke management depends on whether the stroke is ischaemic or haemorrhagic. CT head should be performed on arrival to the emergency department to distinguish ischaemic from haemorrhagic stroke.\n\n* Alteplase (tissue plasminogen activator) is indicated in patients presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset and with no contraindications to thrombolysis (e.g. recent head trauma, GI or intracranial haemorrhage, recent surgery, acceptable BP, platelet count, and INR).\n* Mechanical Thrombectomy can be performed in patients with anterior circulation strokes within 6 hours of symptom onset, provided that they have a good baseline functional status and lack of significant early infarction on initial CT scan. Mechanical Thrombectomy can also be performed in posterior circulation strokes up to 12 hours after onset.\n\nIf hyper-acute treatments are not offered, patients should receive aspirin 300 mg orally once daily for two weeks. If hyper-acute treatments are offered, aspirin is usually started 24 hours after the treatment following a repeat CT Head that excludes any new haemorrhagic stroke.\n\n**Stroke investigations (post-acute)**\n\nInvestigations in the post-acute phase aim to further define the cause of the stroke and to quantify vascular risk factors.\n\nFurther investigations to determine the cause of the stroke include, for example:\n\n- In ischaemic stroke: carotid ultrasound (to identify critical carotid artery stenosis), CT/MR angiography (to identify intracranial and extracranial stenosis), and echocardiogram (if a cardio-embolic source is suspected). In young patients further investigation e.g. a vasculitis screen or thrombophilia screen may be necessary.\n\n- In haemorrhagic stroke: serum toxicology screen (sympathomimetic drugs e.g. cocaine are a strong risk factor for haemorrhagic stroke).\n\nFurther investigations to quantify vascular risk factors include: serum glucose (all patients with stroke should be screened for diabetes with a fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test), serum lipids (to check for raised total cholesterol/LDL cholesterol).\n\n**Stroke management (chronic)**  \n\nThe key steps in secondary stroke prevention can be remembered by the mnemonic HALTSS: \n\n* Hypertension: studies show there is no benefit in lowering the blood pressure acutely (as this may impair cerebral perfusion) unless there is malignant hypertension (systolic blood pressure >180 mmHg). Anti-hypertensive therapy should, however, be initiated 2 weeks post-stroke. \n* Antiplatelet therapy: patients should be administered Clopidogrel 75 mg once daily for long-term antiplatelet therapy. In patients with ischaemic stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation, however, warfarin (target INR 2-3. or a direct oral anticoagulant (such as Rivaroxaban or Apixiban) is initiated 2 weeks post-stroke. \n* Lipid-lowering therapy: patients should be prescribed high dose atorvastatin 20-80 mg once nightly (irrespective of cholesterol level this lowers the risk of repeat stroke).\n* Tobacco: offer smoking cessation support. \n* Sugar: patients should be screened for diabetes and managed appropriately.\n* Surgery: patients with ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis more than 50% should be referred for carotid endarterectomy.  \n\nRehabilitation and supportive management will include an MDT approach with involvement of physio, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, and neurorehabiliation."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd107", "topic": "Neurology", "concept": "Transient Ischaemic Attack", "explanation": "A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is a sudden onset focal neurological deficit of vascular aetiology, with symptoms typically lasting less than 1 hour, and no evidence of acute infarct on imaging.\n\nRisk factors for TIA include: diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, hypertension, smoking, and family history of cardiovascular disease/stroke.

Each type have distinct presentations and clinical findings on CT, and often require neurosurgical intervention. \n\n**Extradural haemorrhage**\n\nThis is a haemorrhage between the skull and dura mater of the meninges. Commonly caused by trauma to the pterion, with subsequent tearing of the middle meningeal artery, patients present with acute severe headache, contralateral hemiplegia, and a rapid deterioration in GCS following a lucid period. On CT, a biconcave haematoma is diagnostic. This occurs as the haemorrhage stops expanding at the sutures of the skull, where the dura meets the skull, causing the haemorrhage to expand towards the brain. Neurosurgical intervention is usually needed.\n\n**Subdural haemorrhage** \n\nThis is a haemorrhage between the dura mater and arachnoid mater. They may be acute, subacute, and chronic, but tend to present more gradually than extradural haemorrhages, with gradually increasing headache and confusion. They tend to occur in older patients. Other risk factors include historic head trauma, alcoholism, and anticoagulation. On CT, a crescent-shaped haematoma is diagnostic. This occurs as expansion of the haemorrhage is not limited by skull sutures, so follows the contour of the skull. Neurosurgical intervention may be needed, if the haemorrhage is severe and symptomatic enough. \n\n**Subarachnoid haemorrhage** \n\nThis is a haemorrhage underneath the arachnoid mater. They present as acute severe headaches, often described as a blow to the back of the head. Seizures, neurological deficits, decreased consciousness, and death may rapidly follow. They may be traumatic or spontaneous, with most cases of the latter caused by a burst aneursym of a vessel in the circle of Willis, and less commonly, ateriovenous malformations. On CT, a white area in the centre of the brain, expanding bilaterally, is indicative of a subarachnoid haemorrhage.

The identification of the neuroanatomic site of seizure onset depends on delineation of seizure semiology by a careful history together with video-EEG, and a variety of neuroimaging technologies such as MRI, fMRI, FDG-PET, MEG, or invasive intracranial EEG recording.\n\nTemporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the commonest form of focal epilepsy and represents almost 2/3 of cases of intractable epilepsy managed surgically. A history of febrile seizures (especially complex febrile seizures) is common in TLE and is frequently associated with mesial temporal sclerosis (the commonest form of TLE). \n\nSeizure auras occur in many TLE patients.

The fundamental features of typical and atypical absence and generalised tonic-clonic seizures are presented below.\n\n**Typical Absence Seizures**\n\nAbsence (petit mal) seizures are brief episodes, usually lasting 3\u201320 seconds, of staring with impairment of awareness and responsiveness. Seizures begin and end suddenly. There is no warning before the seizure, and immediately afterward the person is alert and attentive. If duration is >10 seconds, there are often accompanying motor phenomena (e.g., eye blinks, brief automatic mouth or hand movements, changes in muscle tone). These spells usually begin between ages 4 and 14 years, and usually resolve by age 18. Absence seizures are often provoked by hyperventilation. The EEG signature of absence epilepsy is the generalized 3 Hz spike-wave discharge. Children with typical absence seizures usually have normal development and intelligence. \n\n**Atypical absence seizures** \n\nAtypical absence seizures also occur predominantly in children, usually beginning before 6 years of age. Atypical absences may begin and end gradually (over seconds), usually last 5\u201330 seconds, and are not generally provoked by rapid breathing. The child stares, but the reduction in responsiveness is usually incomplete. Eye blinking or slight twitching movements of the lips may be seen. Because atypical absence seizures often occur in children with global cognitive impairment, the seizures may be difficult to distinguish from the child's usual behaviour. The EEG usually shows generalized \"slow spike-wave\" complexes (i.e., <2.5 Hz). Atypical absence seizures usually arise during childhood, but may persist into adulthood. \n\n**Tonic-Clonic Seizures**\n\nPrimary generalized tonic-clonic (also called grand mal or convulsive seizures) seizures cause loss of consciousness associated with an initial tonic phase of stiffening, a fall, and often a cry evoked by air forced through contracted vocal cords. Legs are usually extended, and arms may be extended, flexed, or each in succession. The subsequent clonic phase consists of jerking of the extremities which gradually increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency before stopping. Tonic-clonic seizures usually last 30\u2013120 seconds. There may be drooling or foaming resulting from lack of swallowing and excessive salivation; biting of the tongue, cheek, or lip, causing bleeding; and bladder or bowel incontinence. Postictal lethargy and confusion often last minutes to hours, and may be followed by transient agitation. The EEG shows generalized polyspikes, but these are usually obscured by muscle artefact. Postictally, there is background suppression and then diffuse slowing."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd10f", "topic": "Neurology", "concept": "Epilepsy syndromes", "explanation": "There are many types of epilepsy. It is important to be able to differentiate between them, as this guides management plans, which vary between different epileptic syndromes. \n\nEpileptic syndromes can be divided into two main categories:\n\n**Focal seizures**\n\n1. **With impairment of consciousness ('complex')**: Patients lose consciousness either after an aura, or at seizure onset. These seizures most commonly originate at the temporal lobe (see 'Features of focal seizures' below). Post-ictal symptoms are common (eg. confusion in temporal lobe seizures).\n2. **Without impairment of consciousness ('simple')**: Patients do not lose consciousness, and only experience focal symptoms. Post-ictal symptoms do not occur.\n3. **Evolving to a bilateral, convulsive seizure ('secondary generalised')**: Patients experience a focal seizure, which then evolves to a generalised seizure, which is typically tonic-clonic. This occurs in 2/3 of patients with focal seizures.\n\n**Features of specific focal seizures:** \n\n1. **Temporal lobe** - Automatisms (eg. lip-smacking); de\u0301ja\u0300 vu or jamais vu, emotional disturbance (eg. sudden terror); olfactory, gustatory, or auditory hallucinations.\n2. **Frontal lobe** - Motor features such as Jacksonian features, dysphasia, or Todd's palsy.\n3. **Parietal lobe** - Sensory symptoms such as tingling and numbness; motor symptoms - due to spread of electrical activity to the pre-central gyrus in the frontal lobe. \n4. **Occipital lobe** - Visual symptoms such as spots and lines in the visual field. \n\n***Treatment***: Carbamazepine (SE: SIADH, drowsiness, diplopia, ataxia) or Lamotrigine (SE: rash, tremor, diplopia) is first-line\n\n**Generalised seizures** \n\n1. **Absence seizures**: Patients, often children, pause briefly, for less than 10 seconds, and then carry on where they left off. *Treatment:* Sodium Valproate (SE: weight gain, hair loss which grows back curly, oedema, ataxia, tremor, teratogenicity) or Ethosuximide is first-line; avoid Carbamazepine as it worsens seizures.\n2. **Tonic-clonic seizures**: Patients lose consciousness; their limbs stiffen (tonic) and start jerking (clonic). Post-ictal confusion is common. *Treatment*: Sodium Valproate or Lamotrigine is first-line. \n3. **Myoclonic seizures**: Sudden jerk of a limb, trunk, or face. *Treatment*: Sodium Valproate is first-line unless the patient is a female of childbearing age where Levetiracetam or Topiramate should be used instead as first-line; avoid Carbamazepine as it worsens seizures. \n4. **Atonic seizures**: Sudden loss of muscle tone, causing the patient to fall, whilst retaining consciousness. *Treatment:* Sodium Valproate or Lamotrigine is first-line. \n\n**Triggers of seizures**: poor sleep, alcohol and drugs (and their withdrawal), stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, space-occupying lesions, metabolic disturbances.\n\n**Complications of epilepsy**: \n\n1. Status epilepticus - >30 minutes of continuous seizures; treat with IV Lorazepam/buccal Midazolam, then Phenytoin if that does not work and call the anaesthetist\n2. Depression\n3. Suicide\n4. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) - thought to be due to excessive electrical activity causing a cardiac arrhythmia and death.\n\n**Epilepsy Management**\n\nThe focus of drug therapy in epilepsy is optimisation of quality of life with control of seizure activity, but any treatment must be balanced against potential side effects (in particular teratogenesis in women of childbearing age). \n\nInitiation of medication is not always appropriate, especially after a \"provoked\" first seizure, and should be discussed with a specialist. \n\nChoice of antiepileptic drugs is a complex area, and often involves a degree of trial and error as very few randomised trials compare different medications head-to-head, and no single drug is clearly more effective or better tolerated. \n\nGeneral rules of thumb: \n\n\n* Lamotrigine, levetiracetam and valproate are good for all seizure types.\n\n* Carbamazepine, gabapentin and phenytoin are better for focal (including secondary generalised) seizures.\n\n*  Ethosuximide is the drug of choice for absence seizures.\n\n*  Carbamazepine may worsen myoclonic seizures.\n\nInteractions with other medications, seen particularly with phenytoin and carbamazepine, should be considered. \n\n\nIssues regarding teratogenicity should also be considered, particularly in the context of valproate use which has a high risk of neural tube defects.

association**\n\nA measure of association quantifies the relationship between exposure and outcome. \n\nDifferent studies use differing measures of association.\n\n**Risk Ratio**\n\nThe risk ratio is the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group compared to the probability occurring in a non-exposed group.\n\nThe risk ratio is calculated by finding the ratio of incidence of a disease amongst the exposed population and the incidence amongst the non-exposed population.\n\nRisk ratios are used in cohort studies and in interventional studies in which the experimenter intervenes at some point during the study, such as in randomised controlled trials and pre-post studies. \n\nHowever, in cross-sectional studies and case-control studies, the incidence of the disease in the exposed and unexposed populations cannot be found, since the data only provides the cases and controls.\n\nConsequently,the risk ratio cannot be calculated for case-control studies and cross-sectional studies.\n\nInstead, an odds ratio must be found.\n\n**Odds Ratio**\n\nThe odds ratio is calculated by finding two odds.\n\nThe odds that an exposed person develops the disease can be found by dividing the number of exposed people with the disease by the number of exposed people without the disease.\n\nThe odds that an unexposed person develops the disease can be found by dividing the number of unexposed people with the disease by the number of unexposed people without the disease.\n\nThe odds ratio can be found by dividing the former by the latter.\n\nThis is described

AxD/BxC\n\n**Attributable risk**\n\nThe attributable risk is another measure of association, which is defined as the amount of proportion of disease incidence (disease risk) that can be attributed to the exposure. \n\nFor example,the risk of lung cancer amongst smokers.\n\nThe attributable risk can be calculated by subtracting the estimate of the risk of developing the disease from the exposed group from the risk of developing the disease from the unexposed group.\n\nFor example,subtracting the risk estimate of developing lung cancer amongst smokers from the risk estimate of developing lung cancer amongst non-smokers. \n\nFor example,if the cumulative incidence of lung cancer amongst smokers = 0.015, and the cumulative incidence of lung cancer amongst non-smokers = 0.005, then the attribute risk=0.01. \n\nThis means that if the excess incidence is completely reversible, stopping smoking would lower the risk of developing lung cancer amongst smokers from 0.015 to 0.005,so the absolute excess incidence that would be prevented by stopping smoking is 0.01 (1%)\n\nThe attributable risk can be calculated from cohort studies and from interventional studies such as randomised controlled trials.\n\n**Proportional mortality**\n\nThe proportional mortality is a measure of association which measures the proportion of all deaths due to a specific cause. \n\nProportional mortality studies therefore compare the proportional mortality in an interest group with a control group, to calculate a proportional mortality ratio.\n\nProportional mortality ratios are only really used in proportional mortality studies.\n\n**Prevalence ratio**\n\nThe prevalence ratio is a measure of association used by case-control studies and cross-sectional studies.\n\nAmongst a group of smokers vs. a group of non-smokers, the prevalence ratio equals the prevalence of lung cancer amongst the smokers divided by the prevalence of lung cancer amongst the non-smokers.\n\nA prevalence ratio of 5 indicates that the proportion of lung cancer is 5 times greater amongst the smoking population than the non-smoking population. \n\n**Rate ratio**\n\nThe rate ratio, or incidence rate ratio, is a measure of association which compares the incidence rate in an exposed group to the incidence rate in a non-exposed group.\n\nThe rate ratio is used in cohort studies and in interventional

It is important to assess the size of the tumour and is very good at identifying local spread and lymph node spread. It will also identify any visceral metastases to the liver or lungs. It is the first-line investigation after endoscopy.\n- MRI is very accurate for identifying metastatic spread to the liver and if there is advanced local disease. It is less accurate for early localized spread and hence a CT scan is preferred.\n- Endoscopic ultrasound is useful to assess whether a tumour is amenable for resection (i.e. ensuring there is no invasion into surrounding structures such as the heart or lungs).

Blockage of common bile duct from a tumour in the pancreatic head leads to obstructive jaundice leads to:\n\n- Courvoisier's sign \u2013 Painless palpable gallbladder with jaundice\n- Pale stool, dark urine\n\n- Diabetes mellitus can be a presentation of a tumour in the      body/tail of the pancreas\n\n- - Expect this in an elderly patient who has newly diagnosed diabetes       and is also LOSING weight\n\n- Infiltration into the pancreas can lead to:\n\n- - Unexplained pancreatitis\n  - Pancreatic exocrine dysfunction with steatorrhoea\n\n- Paraneoplastic syndromes\n\n- - Trousseau's syndrome \u2013 migratory thrombophlebitis affecting the       extremities of the body\n  - Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\n\nPancreatic cancer metastasises early to lung, liver and bowel, which may present with haemoptysis, jaundice or constipation.\n\n**Investigations:**\n\nPainless obstructive jaundice is a red flag symptom of pancreatic carcinoma and should be investigated urgently. This is evidenced by raised bilirubin in association with raised ALP. Other investigations include:\n\n- Initial assessment for pancreatic cancer involves an ultrasound abdomen, which can aid with detection of tumours (> 2cm), possible liver metastases and if there is any dilation of the common bile duct. It is good at detecting tumours within the head of the pancreas, but poorer in determining in tumours in the body or tail and in determining early disease. Hence, a normal ultrasound does not rule out pancreatic carcinoma.\n- Hence, all patients with a high clinical suspicion should have a CT abdomen/pelvis. It is highly specific and can also predict whether surgical resection is a possibility. It is also allows the disease to be staged. PET-FDG and MRI are potential adjuncts which could be used.\n- Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) gives information about the biliary ducts but cannot show extension of the tumour.\n- Endoscopic ultrasound is an invasive test which can detect very small lesions (2 \u2013 3 mm). It can also be used to biopsy a lesion. ERCP can also be used to biopsy the tumour but is largely being replaced by endoscopic ultrasound due to poorer outcomes.\n\n**Treatment:**\n\nResection of a pancreatic tumour is the only potentially curative treatment. However, only 15 \u2013 20% of patients will present with resectable disease as pancreatic cancer often presents very late.\n\nCriteria for resection can include:\n\n- No evidence of involvement of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA)      or coeliac arteries\n- No evidence of distant metastases\n\nA radical pancreaticoduodenectomy (Kausch-Whipple procedure) is the most common procedure used to resect the tumour if in the head of the pancreas. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given after surgery but should only be offered if patients have recovered from surgery well.\n\nIf there is locally advanced or metastatic disease is present, the only option is palliative therapy include \u2013\n\n- Endoscopic stent insertion into bile duct\n- Palliative surgery if endoscopic stent insertion fails\n- Chemotherapy\n- Radiotherapy (only for localized advanced disease)\n\nIt is important in these patients for them to be referred to palliative care, for pain management but also mental and emotional support."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd17f", "topic": "General Surgery", "concept": "Oesophageal carcinoma", "explanation": "Oesophageal carcinoma can be split into adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma is the most common worldwide and usually seen in the top two-thirds of the oesophagus. \n\n**Smoking** is the most important risk factor, but others include:\n\n* High alcohol intake\n* Achalasia\n* Zenker diverticulum\n* Oesophageal web\n* High intake of hot beverages\n* Dietary intake of:\n  - Increased dietary nitrosamines\n  - Areca or betel nuts\n\nAdenocarcinoma is usually present in the lower third of the oesophagus and is associated with obesity and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Recurrent reflux leads to metaplastic formations of mucin-producing glandular tissue known as Barrett's oesophagus. Ongoing reflux will lead to the development of neoplasia. Barrett's oesophagus has an annual rate of conversion to oesophageal adenocarcinoma at a rate of around 0.5% per year.\n\nImportantly, smoking is a key risk factor for both forms of disease, but metaplastic change from squamous cell to glandular cells is directly caused by ongoing reflux (and therefore obesity).\n\nAdenocarcinoma is now the leading cause of oesophageal carcinoma in the Western world due to increasing rates of metabolic syndrome. As mentioned however, squamous cell carcinoma is the leading cause worldwide.\n\n\n**Clinical features of oesophageal carcinoma**\n\nOesophageal carcinoma typically presents with progressive dysphagia from solids to liquids. This differs from motility disorders such as oesophageal spasm and achalasia which tend to have dysphagia to solids and liquids from the start. \n\n- Anyone who presents with dysphagia should immediately indicate an upper GI endoscopy to rule out oesophageal carcinoma. Dysphagia only really occurs when there is obstruction of more than two-thirds of the lumen. Hence, patients often present late. Patients may also have pain on swallowing (odynophagia).\n\n- Weight loss is the second most common symptom, due to a combination of anorexia and dysphagia.\n\n- Hoarseness can develop if there is local invasion of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n\n- The inital investigation for oesophageal carcinoma is always an upper GI endoscopy unless contraindicated. This allows not only visualisation of the tumour, but allows it to be graded via biopsy.\n\n- After endoscopy, the tumour must be staged to assess whether it is resectable. A tumour is not resectable if there is extensive local spread or any distant metastases. There are several methods to assess this.\n\n  - CT chest, abdomen and pelvis is the first tool used. It is important to assess the size of the tumour and is very good at identifying local spread and lymph node spread. It will also identify any visceral metastases to the liver or lungs. It is the first-line investigation after endoscopy.\n\n  - MRI is very accurate for identifying metastatic spread to the liver and if there is advanced local disease. It is less accurate for early localized spread and hence a CT scan is preferred.\n\n  - Endoscopic ultrasound is useful to assess whether a tumour is amenable for resection (i.e. ensuring there is no invasion into surrounding structures such as the heart or lungs). It is the most accurate method of local staging of oesophageal cancer. But due to limited penetration of ultrasound waves, will not inform us about metastatic spread.\n\n  - FDG-PET scan is a very good modality for identifying distant and nodal metastases. However, is almost the opposite of endoscopic ultrasound, as it is very poor at identifying size and extent of regional spread. It is often done before an endoscopic ultrasound, as identifying small distant metastases would mean that surgery to not indicated, hence making an EUS worthless.\n\n  - Laparoscopy can be used to identify intra-abdominal metastases if all other imaging has been negative, however, non-invasive investigations are preferred."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd180", "topic": "General Surgery", "concept": "Small bowel obstruction", "explanation": "Small bowel obstruction is a MECHANICAL disruption of the small bowel, resulting in bilious or faeculent vomiting, abdominal pain and distension as well complete constipation. \n\n**Causes**\n\nFactors outside of the bowel\n\n* Adhesions\n  - Most common cause in the Western World\n  - Previous intra-abdominal operations are the main risk factor for development of adhesions.

Note that patients without lymph node involvement but with high risk features (such as vascular or perineural invasion) also show improved survival with adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n**Principles of screening for colorectal cancer**\n\nThe aim of screening is to detect cancer at an earlier (asymptomatic) stage, when it is easier to treat and patients have a better chance of survival.\n\nCurrent NHS screening programmes include:\n\n- Faecal occult blood test (FOBT) every 2 years for men and women age 60-74. If positive patients are referred for colonoscopy.\n- One-off flexible sigmoidoscopy for men and women at the age of 55. This is typically done to detect and remove polyps.\n\n\nThis screening programme reduces the risk of dying from bowel cancer by 16%.\n\n\n**Urgent 2 week wait referral for possible colorectal cancer** \n\nThis is based on the age of the patients and clinical symptoms. If general, if an unexplained rectal or abdominal mass is felt or there is any unexplained rectal bleeding, this warrants urgent referral.

It allows \u2013\n\n* Direct visualization of the colon\n* Biopsies to be taken\n* Removal of any polyps seen\n\nIf colonoscopy cannot be performed, either due to technical difficulties, poor tolerance of bowel preparation or there is an increased risk of colonic perforation a CT colonoscopy is a suitable alternative but does not allow biopsy.\n\nAfter a histological diagnosis is made, a CT chest, abdomen and pelvis should be performed to stage the disease, so an appropriate intervention can be planned.\n\nIn rectal disease, a pelvic MRI or endorectal ultrasound are preferred over CT scan, as are better for identifying locally invasive disease.\n\nCarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is not used as a diagnostic tool but can be used to monitor therapeutic response to interventions.\n\n**Management of colorectal cancer**\n\nManagement depends on factors relating to both the tumour (the stage and location) and the patient (surgical fitness).\n\nFor patients with **colon cancer** suitable for surgery:\nFor *stage I-III disease*: surgical resection \u00b1 post-operative chemotherapy.\nThe type of surgery depends on the tumour site: right hemicolectomy for tumours of the caecum and ascending colon, left hemicolectomy for tumours of the distal transverse colon and descending colon, and sigmoid colectomy for tumours of the sigmoid colon.\n\nPatients with *stage III disease* (lymph node involvement) benefit from post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nFor *stage IV disease* (metastases): treatment is as above, but pre-operative chemotherapy may also be performed. The staged colectomy and resection of metastatic disease is performed after pre-operative chemotherapy.\n\nFor patients with **rectal cancer** suitable for surgery:\nAnterior resection for tumours >8 cm from the anal canal or involving the proximal 1/3 of the rectum.\nAbdomino-perineal (AP) resection for tumours <8 cm from the anal canal or involving the distal 2/3 of the rectum.\n\nPatients with stage III disease benefit from post-operative chemotherapy. \n\nPatients with stage IV disease benefit from post-operative chemoradiotherapy.\n\nFor patients unsuitable for surgery management is with chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI i.e. oxaliplatin/irinotecan plus folinic acid plus fluorouracil are the preferred regimens).\n\nNew monoclonal antibody therapies are becoming available. Note that NICE concluded that cetuximab (anti-EGFR), but not bevacizumab (anti-VEGF), is cost effective in combination with chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nNote that stenting may be used as a palliative measure for patients with obstructing tumours of the sigmoid colon or rectum.\nIf the patient presents with acute bowel obstruction, a Hartmann's procedure may be required as an interim measure (resection of the rectosigmoid colon with formation of a temporary end colostomy and anorectal stump).\n\n**Types of colonic resection**\n\n- Abdomino-perineal (AP) resection is used for tumours <8 cm from the anal margin.

A recent alcoholic binge or a history of gallstones are highly suggestive. \n\n- Many drugs can pre-dispose acute pancreatitis, hence a drug history is important.\n\n- Signs can be variable. Look for symptoms of hypovolaemia (tachycardia, dry mucous membranes due to third-space losses of fluid. \n\n- Fever is only present if pancreatitis has been complicated with infection \n\n- There may be guarding in the epigastric region, however, these are relatively non-specific signs.\n\n- Haemorrhagic pancreatitis although rare shows signs that are Gray-Turner's sign is known as bruising along the flanks and indicates retroperitoneal bleeding which is highly associated with acute pancreatitis. \n\n- Cullen's sign indicates bruising around the peri-umbilical area which again is highly associated with pancreatitis.\n\n- Third space fluid sequestration in pancreatitis is the result of a combination of inflammatory mediators, vasoactive mediators and tissues which lead to vascular injury, vasoconstriction and increased capillary permeability leading to extravasation of fluid into the third space.\n\n  This can lead to ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), pleural effusions and hypovolaemia leading to AKI (Acute Kidney Injury).\n\n\n**Investigations**\n\nDue to the risk of dehydration in pancreatitis, basic blood tests and review of renal function is imperative. Leukocytosis can also indicate the presence of necrotizing pancreatitis. LFT's may also be abnormal if there is gallstone disease.\n\nAn amylase 3x the upper limit of normal is extremely suggestive of acute pancreatitis.\n\n**Importantly, the degree of elevation of amylase is not related to the severity of the disease.**\n\nHowever, other causes such as perforated duodenal ulcer, cholecystitis and mesenteric infarction may also elevate amylase although to a lesser extent. Lipase is a more sensitive and specific marker but is not in widespread use as of yet.\n\nImaging tests are not useful for the diagnosis of pancreatitis, but may be useful to identify causes.

It is caused by nerve damage to the autonomic nervous system. The vagus nerve is responsible for controlling the gastric muscles and if this is damaged can lead to delayed gastric emptying, offensive egg smelling burps due to bacterial overgrowth, early satiety, abnormal stomach wall movements, morning nausea and fluctuations in blood glucose levels as there is often a mismatch between food ingested food a meal and the insulin dose being injected that would normally be intended to cover the glucose rise after eating that meal.\n\nTreatment includes the use of motility agents such as metoclopramide or domperidone, tight glycaemic control, antibiotics such as Erythromycin to kill off the bacterial overgrowth and botox injections to relax the gastric outflow obstruction. Gastric pacemakers are occasionally used if all else fails.\n\n**Autonomic neuropathy**\n\nPostural hypotension is a recognised consequence of autonomic nervous system damage in people with long standing diabetes. \nPostural or orthostatic hypotension is defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure by 20mmHg or more after changing position or posture, typically from lying to standing. A drop in blood pressure on movement can lead to dizziness, falls and loss of consciousness. Sitting or standing slowly may help with light headedness. It can be exacerbated by dehydration (which can occur if a patient has hyperglycaemia and consequent polyuria).\nTreatments include increased dietary salt, the use of salt retaining hormones ie. Fludrocortisone, raising the head of the bed to retrain the body's baroreceptors and wearing elasticated stockings to overcome venous pooling in the peripheries.\n\n**Peripheral arterial disease**\n\nPeripheral arterial disease is a recognised macrovascular complication of diabetes. This can manifest in many ways in the feet and it is important that patients with diabetes and their carers are educated about good foot self surveillance and care strategies and that their feet are reviewed on a regular basis. PAD treatment is based around managing cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nIf the circulation is compromised then this can manifest itself in several ways including foot discolouration, gangrene, intermittent claudication, rest pain, night pain and absent peripheral pulses (confirmed on doppler). If a patient is found to have critical ischaemia then they are at risk of losing their foot and need to be urgently seen by a multi-disciplinary specialist diabetic foot team which includes a vascular surgeon.\n\n**Diabetic foot infections**\n\nIn patients with vascular and neuropathic complications of diabetes, they are at high risk of diabetic foot ulceration and subsequent infection. Once an infected diabetic ulcer sets in, it can be very difficult to treat and may take a very long time to treat and heal. \n\nManagement requires multi-disciplinary input with consideration to good glycaemic and blood pressure control, stopping smoking, improving the circulation (potentially with angioplasty or bypass surgery), debridement of the wound, the use of larvae therapy (maggots) and antibiotics. \n\nDiabetics with ulcers commonly experience infection with gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, and gram-negative organisms like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus species and anaerobes.\n\nAntibiotic therapy should be targeted at the likely organisms and often very prolonged courses are required, especially if an ulcer is deep and probes down to bone tissue - in such situations, osteomyelitis is likely and needs to be treated aggressively.\n\nMRI is the imaging modality of choice to diagnose osteomyelitis as it does not reliably show up on plain X-rays.\n\n**Sexual dysfunction**\n\nSexual dysfunction is a common complication of diabetes.There are many reasons for this, poor glycaemic control, neuropathy, microvascular complications, obesity, hypertension, depression, medication side effects, alcohol, cannabis, hypogonadism etc. \n\nErectile dysfunction (ED) is a common presenting complaint.\n\nCareful history taking is required to assess the onset and duration, pattern of the ED ie. whether spontaneous morning erections are still present, and associated features such as lethargy, weakness, mood changes, shaving frequency etc.\nLow testosterone (hypogonadism) can be primary (testicular failure) or secondary (pituitary) and needs to be screened for using a 9AM testosterone blood test (this is the peak time of release because of diurnal hormone secretion patterns) and gonadotrophins (LH and FSH). Nerve damage in neuropathy, blood vessel damage in vascular disease and psychological problems such as depression all also contribute to ED, given that having an erection is a complex physiological process. ED is also an important independent predictor of coronary heart disease risk.\n\n\n**Cardiac complications**\n\nDiabetes is a large contributor to the burden of people with coronary heart disease and cardiac complications. \n\nDiabetes is a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. \n\nHeart and circulation problems are the commonest cause of death for diabetics causing 75% of all deaths, with heart attacks accounting for 30% of all deaths. \n\nThe risk of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes is 5 times higher in middle aged men and 8 times higher in women with diabetes.\n\nMore than half of people with type 2 diabetes will exhibit signs of cardiovascular disease complications at diagnosis. \n\nHyperglycaemia, which characterises diabetes, in combination with free fatty acids in the blood can change the makeup of blood vessels, and this can lead to cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe lining of the blood vessels may become thicker, and this in turn can impair blood flow. Myocardial infarction is commonly caused by a clot preventing blood supply to the heart. The symptoms of a heart attack include a strong pain or tightness in the centre of the chest, shortage of breath, coughing, a strong feeling of anxiety, collapse and sudden death.\n\nThe large prospective UKPDS study showed that long term blood pressure control is more important for controlling complications than long term glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes.\nDiagnosis of diabetes is done on strict biochemical cut-offs which have been set based on the likelihood of diabetic complications at various average blood glucose levels.\n\nStudies such as the DIGAMI study show that careful control of hyperglycaemia is very important for recovery and that the use of insulin therapy for 3 months following an MI can significantly improve outcomes in poorly controlled patients with diabetes.\n\nProspective cross-cultural, cohort, and intervention studies showed that diet and smoking are major determinants of coronary heart disease occurrence. In addition to dietary factors and smoking, alcohol and physical activity are important determinants of the individual risk for coronary heart disease.  The observational evidence about these risk factors is very strong and consistent. Stopping smoking is the most important measure for both primary and secondary prevention.\n\n**Management**\n\nPatient education is integral to ensure patients take steps to avoid further progression of their disease and associated complications. This involves diet advice, encouraging regular physical activity and smoking cessation advice.\n\nMeasure HbA1c levels at 3-6 month intervals. \n\nIf the patient is on insulin or is at risk of hypoglycaemia, self-monitoring of glucose at home is necessary.\n\nInitial drug treatment is usually metformin. Pioglitazone, DPP\u20114 inhibitors, sulphonylureas or SGLT-2 inhibitors may be options for some patietns who cannot take metformin.\n\nFollowing this, consider dual therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, a DPP\u20114 inhibitor or a sulphonylurea (such as gliclizide).\n\nIf dual therapy has not conrolled drug glucose, triple therapy using the above medications can be considered.

Vomiting is rare\n\n- ***Salmonella enteritidis/typhimurium*** - Second most common cause of food poisoning in the UK. Gram-negative bacteria that multiply locally in the small and large intestines, invade the mucosa and cause inflammation. Incubation period of 16-48 hours, with common sources being eggs and foods contaminated on kitchen preparation surfaces\n\n- ***Bacillus cereus*** - gram-positive rods that produce 2 toxins, an emetic pre-formed enterotoxin that is absorbed into the blood-stream from the stomach, and a diarrhoea-causing enterotoxin that acts on receptors in the small intestine and large bowel. Symptoms start 30 minutes to 6 hours after eating contaminated food (due to the pre-formed toxin), and profuse vomiting is a common feature. Fever is usually absent. Rice is a common source, as it provides the carbohydrate for the bacteria to produce the toxins. These are heat stable, so when the rice is reheated they remain active\n\n- ***S. aureus*** - produces a heat-stable enterotoxin, that causes profuse vomiting with mild diarrhoea and abdominal pain. The incubation period is rapid, between 1-6 hours, and the most common sources are contaminated milk products and foods contaminated through contact with food workers who carry the bacteria. High-risk foods are those made by hand and require no cooking, including puddings, pastries, sandwiches and sliced meat\n\n- ***Clostridium perfringens*** - gram-positive rods that are part of normal gut flora, so proof of food poisoning can only be obtained by showing contamination of the food-stuff, not through stool testing. It releases an enterotoxin in the gut that leads to moderate diarrhoea and colicky abdominal pain, with vomiting and fever being rare features. The incubation period is 12-24 hours, and red meat is a common source of infection \n\n- ***E.coli*** (including E.coli 0157) - part of normal stomach flora but some acquire pathogenic features that cause disease. Diagnosis can be achieved through specific strain identification (through 'O' somatic antigens) or through direct demonstration of toxins or the genes coding for them. Depending on the strain, diarrhoea can be dysenteric (with blood and/or mucus) or non-dysenteric, and sources include improperly cooked or cheap cuts of meat and petting zoos or farms. E.coli 0157 is also known as enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) or Verotoxin producing E.coli (ETEC), and releases an enterotoxin that causes bloody diarrhoea. The incubation period is 16-48 hours, and is linked to  the development of Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS). HUS usually affects the very young or old, and is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by hemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and acute renal failure (with normal clotting profile)\n\n- **Norovirus** - previously known as Norovirus, causes projectile vomiting and moderate non-bloody diarrhoea.

In these cases signs and symptoms of both left and right sided heart failure may be present.\n\n\n\n**New York Heart Association Classification of Heart failure**\n\nThe NYHA Classification system is used to classify severity of cardiovascular disability through severity of exertional dyspnoea limiting activity, or discomfort at rest. It runs from Class I (no limitation) to Class IV (discomfort at rest).\n\n- Class I - no limitation in physical activity, and activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation or dyspnoea.\n- Class II - slight limitation of physical activity, and comfort at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation and/or dyspnoea.\n- Class III - marked limitation in physical activity, but comfort at rest. Minimal physical activity causes fatigue (less than ordinary).\n- Class IV - inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort, with symptoms occurring at rest. If any activity takes place, discomfort increases.\n\n\n\n**Investigation**s\n\nInvestigations depends on the presentation of the patient.\n\nIn a patient presenting to the general practitioner with suspected heart failure investigations should be carried out as follows:\n\n1. ECG: To assess for underlying cause (e.g. myocardial infarction)\n2. Measurement of **NT-proBNP**. BNP is released by the ventricles in response to myocardial stretch. BNP has a high negative predictive value, so if the BNP is not raised the diagnosis of congestive cardiac failure is highly unlikely. If the BNP is raised, the patient should be referred for trans-thoracic echocardiogram.\n   - If BNP>2000ng/L the patient needs an urgent 2 week referral for specialist assessment and an ECHO.\n   - If BNP 400-2000ng/L the patient should get a 6 week referral for specialist assessment and an ECHO.\n3. ECHO will confirm the presence and degree of ventricular dysfunction.\n   - Ventricular dysfunction is normally measured by the ejection fraction.\n     - <40% = heart failure is reduced ejection fraction\n     - Greater than 40% but raised BNP = Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction\n4. Other blood tests may be useful include:\n   - U+Es to assess renal function (for medication) and to look for hyponatraemia\n   - LFTs for hepatic congestion\n   - TFTs to check for hyperthyroidism\n   - Glucose and lipid profile to assess modifiable cardiovascular risk factors\n\nFurther investigations in heart failure include:\n\nBedside tests include an electrocardiogram (ECG). This may be normal or reveal clues as to the underlying cause of the heart failure (e.g. ischaemic changes or arrhythmias).\n\nBlood tests to exclude reversible causes of heart failure (FBC to check for anaemia, TFT to check for hyperthyroidism). U&Es are necessary as a baseline before starting an ACE inhibitor and diuretics. LFTs may be abnormal if there is hepatic congestion. Glucose and lipids are useful to address modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n\n\nIn a patient presenting to the Emergency Department:\n\n- ECG\n- Bloods including U+Es, NT-proBNP and inflammatory markers.\n- Chest x-ray findings in heart failure can be remembered by the ABCDEF mnemonic:\n  - A: **Alveolar** oedema (with 'batwing' perihilar shadowing)\n  - B: **Kerley B** lines (caused by interstitial oedema)\n  - C: **Cardiomegaly** (cardiothoracic ratio >0.5)\n  - D: upper lobe blood **diversion**\n  - E: **Pleural effusions** (typically bilateral transudates)\n  - F: **Fluid in the horizontal fissure**\n- ECHO - Often cannot be done immediately so management is often initiated beforehand.\n\n\n\n**Management**\n\nManagement of chronic heart failure:\n\n- Lifestyle modification:\n  - Smoking cessation\n  - <u>Salt and fluid restriction (this improves mortality)</u>\n  - Supervised cardiac rehabilitation\n- Pharmacological management:\n  - <u>ACE-inhibitor and beta-blocker (these improve mortality)</u>\n    - Consider angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) if intolerant to ACE inhibitors\n    - Consider hydralazine and a nitrate intolerant to ACE-I and ARB.\n  - Loop diuretics such as furosemide  or bumetanide improve symptoms (but NOT mortality)\n  - If symptoms persist and NYHA Class 3 or 4 consider: \n    - <u>Aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone. These drugs also improve mortality.</u>\n    - Hydralazine and a nitrate for Afro-Caribbean patients\n    - Ivabradine if in sinus rhythm and impaired ejection fraction\n    - Angiotensin receptor blocker\n- If the above treatments do not control symptoms:\n  - Cardiac resynchronisation therapy\n    - ICDs are indicated if the following criteria are fulfilled:\n      - QRS interval <120ms, high risk sudden cardiac death, NYHA class I-III\n      - QRS interval 120-149ms without LBBB, NYHA class I-III\n      - QRS interval 120-149ms with LBBB, NYHA class I\n  - Digoxin - useful in those with AF. This <u>worsens</u> mortality but improves morbidity.\n\n\n\nManagement of acute heart failure (pulmonary oedema):\n\n1. Sit the patient up\n2. Oxygen therapy (aiming saturations >94% in normal circumstances)\n3. IV furosemide 40mg (with further doses as necessary) and close fluid balance (aiming for a negative balance)\n4. IV morphine - this is contentious with some studies suggesting that it might increase mortality by suppressing respiration\n5. Further management (usually in a high care setting):\n   - CPAP - reduces hypoxia and may help push fluid out of alveoli\n   - Intubation and ventilation\n   - Furosemide infusion - continuous IV furosemide given over 24 hours to maximise diuresis\n   - Dopamine infusion - Continuous IV dopamine given over 24 hours. It works by inhibiting sympathetic drive and thereby increasing myocardial contractility.\n   - Intra-aortic balloon pump - if the patient is in cardiogenic shock\n   - Ultrafiltration - If resistant to or contraindicated for diuretics \n\n(Note that GTN infusion is no longer routinely used in acute heart failure)\n\n\n\n**Adverse effects of heart failure medication**\n\nCommon adverse effects for different medications are listed below\n\n- **Beta blockers**: Bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, dizziness\n- **ACE inhibitors**: Hyperkalaemia, renal impairment, dry cough, lightheadedness, fatigue, GI disturbances, angioedema\n- **Spironolactone**: Hyperkalaemia, renal impairment, gynaecomastia, breast tenderness/hair growth in women, changes in libido\n- **Furosemide**: Hypotension, hypoatraemia/kalaemia, \n- **Hydralazine/nitrate**: Headache, palpitation, flushing\n- **Digoxin**: Dizziness, blurred vision, GI disturbances"}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd261", "topic": "Cardiology", "concept": "Acute narrow complex tachycardias", "explanation": "Management is according to the Resuscitation Council adult tachycardia algorithm.\n\n1.

This causes electrical re-entrant pathways within the atria, and recurrent uncoordinated atrial contraction.\n\nThe atrioventricular node (AVN) only conducts some of these atrial impulses, resulting in an irregular ventricular response (hence the irregularly irregular pulse).\n\n\n\n**Features**\n\nAtrial fibrillation is classified as: \n\n- Acute (lasts <48 hours)\n- Paroxysmal (lasts <7 days and is intermittent)\n- Persistent (lasts >7 days but is amenable to cardioversion)\n- Permanent (lasts >7 days and is not amenable to cardioversion)\n\n\nSymptoms of atrial fibrillation include palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness.\n\n\nClinical signs of atrial fibrillation include:\n\n* An irregularly irregular pulse rate with a variable volume pulse.\n* A single waveform on the jugular venous pressure (due to loss of the a wave - this normally represents atrial contraction).\n* An apical to radial pulse deficit (as not all atrial impulses are mechanically conducted to the ventricles).\n* On auscultation there may be a variable intensity first heart sound.\n\nIt is important to ascertain in the history and examination whether there are any features suggestive of the underlying cause (e.g. hyperthyroidism, alcohol excess) and any features suggestive of complications resulting from the atrial fibrillation (e.g. heart failure).\n\nAF is a relatively safe rhythm and complications normally occur when it occurs int he presence of other pathologies such as sepsis or pulmonary disease where physiological reserve is being stretched.\n\nWhen ventricular rate is >100bpm it is considered to be **fast AF** which normally warrants some level of immediate treatment. \n\n\n\n**Management**\n\nImmediate management depends on whether the AF is acute or chronic and whether the patient is haemodynamically stable or unstable. When managing AF patients a process such as the one below be useful:\n\n1. Is the patient haemodynamically stable?\n   - Signs of instability are:\n     - Shock (suggests end organ hypoperfusion)\n     - Syncope (evidence of brain hypoperfusion)\n     - Chest pain (evidence of myocardial ischaemia)\n     - Pulmonary oedema (evidence of heart failure)\n   - If the patient is unstable then they should have **immediate DC cardioversion** \n2. If the patient is stable then consider reversible causes and appropriate treatments for them:\n   - If infection: Antibiotics and fluids\n   - If dehydrated: Fluids\n   - Replace abnormal electrolytes\n3. If AF persists or reversible causes are not present then decisions should be made about rate control, rhythm control or electrical cardioversion.\n   - DC Cardioversion:\n     - If the AF is acute (**<48 hours**) then the patient can be DC cardioverted with sedation.\n     - If the AF is >48 hours (or onset is uncertain) then the patient must be anticoagulated for 28 days before DC cardioversion can be done. Alternatively the patient can have a **transoesophageal ECHO** to rule out a thrombus in the left atrial appendage before cardioversion.\n     - Note that patients in chronic AF or those who have failed cardioversion before are unlikely to be successfully cardioverted so this would not be considered in most of these cases.\n\n   - Rate vs rhythm control:\n     - Most undergraduate exams would not expect students to choose between rate and rhythm control.\n     - Outcomes are similar between the options but there is some evidence that rate control has a slightly lower stroke risk associated with it.\n     - Rate control is generally more suitable in elderly patients (>70 years) and those who are more prone to drug interactions and the pro-arrhythmic effects of anti-arrhythmic therapy.\n\n   - Rate control:\n     - Achieved by slowing the transmission of electrical transmission through the AV node.\n     - The aim of treatment is to keep heart rate <100bpm.\n     - Medication choices include:\n       - Beta-blocker (normal **bisoprolol**)\n         - Commonly used medication for acute treatment and chronic management.\n         - Technically contraindicated in COPD and asthma (in reality unless the conditions are considered *brittle* it is not a problem).\n         - Cannot be used in hypotension because it will drop blood pressure.\n         - Note that sotalol CANNOT be used as a rate control agent because of its rhythm control action.\n       - *Non-dihydropyridine* calcium channel block (diltiazem or verapamil)\n         - Not frequently used in hospital settings because it is *negatively ionotropic* meaning that it is <u>contraindicated in heart failure</u>\n       - Digoxin\n         - <u>Usual for patients who are hypotensive or have co-existent heart failure.</u>\n         - Should be avoided in younger patients because it increases cardiac mortality.\n         - Often used second-line in conjunction with beta-blockers if fast AF remains refractory.\n\n   - Rhythm control:\n\n     - Rhythm control is favoured over rate control in the management of paroxysmal/persistent atrial fibrillation in the following scenarios:\n       - Young patients\n       - Patients with disabling symptoms from the atrial fibrillation.\n     - Options include:\n       - Flecainide (Na channel blocker)\n         - Can be either given regularly or as a \"pill in the pocket\" when symptoms come on.\n         - Is preferred in *young patients* who have *structurally normal hearts* because it can induce fatal arrhythmias in structurally abnormal hearts.\n       - Amiodarone (multi-class action)\n         - Extremely effective drug in controlling both rate and rhythm.\n         - However it comes with a massive list of significant side-effects so should normally only be given to *older, sedentary patients*.\n       - Sotalol (beta blocker with additional K channel blocker action)\n         - Used for those that don't meet the demographics for either flecainide or amiodarone.\n4.

It can present acutely and progress rapidly with symptoms of heart failure (typically on normal valves), or it can present subacutely/chronically with nonspecific symptoms (typically on abnormal or prosthetic valves).\n\n*Fever* is the most common symptom, along with chills, anorexia and weight loss.

AF can also worsen dyspnoea.\n- Chest pain - can occur as a result of pulmonary hypertension and R ventricular hypertrophy, or due to AF with fast ventricular response.\n- Thromboembolism (cerebral or systemic) - secondary to AF\n- Hoarseness - enlarged L atrium can compress the recurrent laryngeal  nerve\n- Peripheral oedema / abdominal discomfort (hepatomegaly) - due to right heart failure\n\nSigns:\n\n- Mitral facies (malar flush) - cutaneous vasodilation due to carbon dioxide retention\n- Low volume pulse\n- Atrial fibrillation\n- Elevated JVP (prominent 'a' wave due to raised right atrial pressure, or absent 'a' wave in AF)\n- Tapping, non-displaced apex beat (palpable S1)\n- R ventricular heave (suggestive of pulmonary hypertension)\n- Inspiratory crepitations (pulmonary oedema) and other signs of right heart failure\n\nCardiac auscultation findings:\n\n- Loud S1 (becomes softer with increasing calcification)\n\n- Loud P2 with pulmonary hypertension (later stages S2 split)\n\n- Opening snap heard at apex (only with pliable valves)\n\n- Diastolic murmur\n\n- - low pitched rumble\n  - most prominent at apex\n  - loudest in expiration\n  - heard best with patient lying on left side\n  - heard best using stethoscope bell (low frequency)\n\n- Graham-Steell murmur (early diastolic murmur - only if pulmonary regurgitation present, secondary to pulmonary hypertension)\n\nOther investigations\n\n- ECG may show: \n- P-mitrale (a broad notched P wave due to left atrial enlargement)\n- Right ventricular hypertrophy\n- Right axis deviation\n- Atrial fibrillation - caused by left atrial enlargement\n- CXR may show evidence of pulmonary oedema and left atrial enlargement\n\n\n\n**Management**\n\n- If left untreated, the mechanical obstruction in mitral stenosis can lead to raised left atrial pressures, and subsequently raised pressures in the pulmonary vasculature and the right heart.\n- Optimal timing of intervention is crucial as many cases can remain asymptomatic and stable, and may not require treatment at all. However, delay can lead to irreversible pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. For this reason, patients with asymptomatic MS should undergo regular follow up echocardiography to assess progression.\n- Patients with atrial fibrillation should be anticoagulated and rate-controlled.\n- Diuretics and \u03b2 blockers can provide symptomatic relief in decompensated states due to illness, or for stabilisation prior to intervention. Medical management however is not an alternative to definitive interventional treatment.\n- For symptomatic patients, there are three treatment options:\n  - Balloon valvuloplasty - only appropriate if valve is pliable and non-calcified\n  - Percutaneous mitral valvotomy - for patients with moderate disease\n  - Open valve repair/replacement - for patients with severe disease who are not too high risk for surgery but are not candidates for percutaneous intervention, due to valve morphology or otherwise. Valves are more likely to be metal than bioprosthetic.\n\n- Treatment is difficult in patients with severe disease or inadequate valve morphology who are poor candidates / high risk for open surgery.\n\n\n\n**Complications**\n\nIn the absence of intervention, mitral stenosis progressively may cause worsening symptoms over time. Progression is first slow in asymptomatic patients, however once symptoms begin the progression occurs more rapidly.

Analgesia for arthritic symptoms \n   - Aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen. \n   - Aspirin should be used with caution in young children due to the small risk of Reye syndrome.\n   - There is no evidence to suggest that NSAIDs help with outcomes related to carditis.\n3. If carditis is complicated by heart failure\n   - Glucocorticoids (e.g. Prednisolone) can provide benefit (NSAIDs should be stopped concurrently). \n   - Diuretic treatment may also be necessary, and valve surgery if severe.\n4.

Erythema marginatum is associated with rheumatic fever is temporary and doesn't require treatment, although antihistamines can help with pruritus.\n\n**Valve Complications**\nRheumatic heart disease is a major cause of valvulopathy in children and young adults in the developing world. The most recent study in 2015 suggests that year there were over 30 million cases worldwide. Streptococcal antigens secondary to bacterial infection cross-reacts with the valve tissue, causing damage. Progressive damage commonly occurs in the years following acute rheumatic fever.\n\nMitral disease occurs in 70% of cases and is the most common affected valve; aortic valves are involved in 40% (most commonly regurgitation), tricuspid valves in 10% and pulmonary valves in 2%.\n\nThe commonest presentations of valve defects secondary to rheumatic heart disease are:\n\n- Mitral stenosis - isolated mitral stenosis it is the most commonly encountered single valve lesion secondary to rheumatic heart disease\n- Mitral regurgitation\n- Mixed mitral stenosis and regurgitation\n- Aortic regurgitation\n- Aortic stenosis (rare in isolation)\n- Tricuspid regurgitation or stenosis"}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd278", "topic": "Cardiology", "concept": "Mitral regurgitation", "explanation": "Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the backflow of blood across the mitral valve during systole due to incompetence of the mitral valve.\n\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nMitral regurgitation can be grouped by cause into two broad categories - acute and chronic.\n\nAcute mitral regurgitation is a cardiac emergency and may present with sudden onset pulmonary oedema, hypotension and cariogenic shock. Causes can be described along the following lines:\n\n- Ischaemic MR - primarily due to papillary muscle rupture secondary to myocardial infarction.\n- Non-ischaemic MR - ruptured chordae tendineae due to any of a number of causes\n  - Myxomatous disease (mitral prolapse)\n  - Infective endocarditis\n  - Rheumatic heart disease - acute or chronic\n  - Trauma\n  - Spontaneous rupture\n- Prosthetic valve MR\n  - Tissue valvelet rupture due to endocarditis, degeneration or calcification\n  - Paravalvular regurgitation due to infection or suture rupture\n  - Valve thrombus or infection causing impaired closure\n\nIt is helpful to think of chronic mitral regurgitation in terms of dysfunction of various parts of the valve: the leaflets, chordae tendineae, papillary muscles and annulus (and in the case of prosthetic valves, complications related to the implant).\n\n- Leaflet related\n  - Degenerative disease (causing prolapse)\n  - Rheumatic fever (presents typically in the younger patients <20, whereas MS is more common in older patients)\n  - Infective endocarditis\n  - Systemic inflammatory disorders e.g. SLE, scleroderma\n  - Connective tissue disorders e.g. Marfan's, Ehlers-Danlos syndromes\n  - Congenital causes e.g. mitral valve clefts\n  - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causing abnormal valve movements\n  - Drug related damage, e.g. ergotamine, bromocriptine, 'fen-phen' (fenfluramine - anorectic drug, now banned)\n- Chordae related\n  - Myxomatous valve disease (causing prolapse)\n  - Trauma\n- Papillary muscle related\n  - Myocardial ischemia or infarction (regional wall motion abnormalities - RWMA - can cause inadequate systolic function and poor closure)\n  - Dilated cardiomyopathy\n- Annular related\n  - Calcification, either due to rheumatic fever or age-related\n  - Dilation due to dilated cardiomyopathy or connective tissue disorders\n- Prosthesis related\n  - Paravalvular leak\n  - Ring or strut fracture\n  - Leaflet deterioration in tissue valves\n  - Infective endocarditis\n  - Thrombus or pannus formation which can obstruct valve closure\n\n\n\n**Presentation**\n\n**Acute mitral regurgitation** is usually a cardiac emergency and presents with sudden onset symptoms of:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n- Exertional dyspnoea\n- Fatigue\n- Weakness\n\nThey typically have overt pulmonary oedema, hypotension and signs of cardiogenic shock. Quite often they may be misdiagnosed as having an acute pulmonary process rather than MR.\n\nWith chronic mitral regurgitation, the symptoms are associated with the degree of impairment: \n\n- Patients with mild to moderate MR may be asymptomatic until there is significant systolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension or symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF).\n- Fatigue and exertional dyspnoea are most common, a result of decreased cardiac output as well as increased pulmonary pressures due to increased L atrial pressures.\n\n- Severe MR patients also have signs of heart failure with pulmonary oedema and peripheral oedema.\n\n\nThromboembolism secondary to AF, haemoptysis secondary to pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of right heart failure are possible but less common than in mitral stenosis (MS). Infective endocarditis and associated symptoms can also complicate MR.\n\nExamination findings include:\n\n- Systolic murmur\n  - Loudest at the apex\n  - Pansystolic in nature\n  - Radiates to the axilla\n  - Louder on expiration\n  - Louder on rolling to the left\n- S1 may be quiet or absent\n- If patients are in decompensated heart failure\n  - Bilateral lung crepitations\n  - Raised JVP\n  - S3/S4\n  - Peripheral/sacral oedema oedema\n\nDiagnosis is made using ECHO which also allows measurement of severity by assessing factors such as:\n\n- Size and pressure of the regurgitant jet\n- Size of valve lesions\n- Structural complications such as left atrial enlargement or systolic disfunction\n\nOther investigations\n\n- ECG may show: \n  1. P-mitrale (a broad notched P wave due to left atrial enlargement)\n  2. Right ventricular hypertrophy\n  3. Right axis deviation.\n- Chest x-ray may show evidence of pulmonary oedema and left atrial enlargement\n\n\n\n**Management**\n\nMitral regurgitation (MR) treatment is multifaceted.\n\n- Treat concurrent complications:\n  - AF - rate control and anticoagulation\n  - Thromboembolism - anticoagulation\n  - Heart failure - Diuretics, ACE-Inhibitors, beta-blockers\n- In acute MR, adjuncts such as Nitroprusside and intra-aortic balloon pumps can aid stabilisation while awaiting surgical treatment.\n- The definitive management for symptomatic MR is surgery - there are two main options:\n  - Mitral valve repair (mitral valvuloplasty) - this is preferable as is preserves all components of the native valve and avoids use of prostheses.\n  - Mitral valve replacement - offers the choice between a mechanical valve (lifelong anticoagulation but long-lasting), and a bioprosthetic valve (limited durability but no need for anticoagulation)\n\n\n\n**Mitral valve prolapse**\n\nMitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common cause of mitral regurgitation (approx 5% of cases).\n\nDiagnosis of MVP is related to clinical examination and echocardiographic findings. Prolapse is defined as abnormal systolic displacement of one or both leaflets into the left atrium. This is defined by echocardiogram to be >2mm above the annular plane.\n\nMVP can be primary (i.e., related to degeneration in the absence of other causes, most common) or secondary to other identifiable disorders. Notably, primary MVP can also be familial in nature.\n\nConditions which predispose to secondary prolapse are:\n\n- Marfan's syndrome\n- Ehlers-Danlos\n- Pseudoxanthoma elasticum\n- Osteogenesis imperfecta\n- Turner's syndrome\n\nSymptoms are inconsistent and do not reliably indicate MVP but may include chest pain, palpitations, dyspnoea, exercise intolerance and dizziness. The majority of cases remain asymptomatic unless prolapse is severe. \n\nExamination findings include:\n\n- A non-ejection click (not an early systolic ejection click) which is variable in timing (due to snapping of the mitral chordae during systole when the valve bows into the atrium) \n- Mitral regurgitation murmur\n\nMVP may occur in one of two contexts:\n\n1. Chronic mitral regurgitation - this develops insidiously and later presents as severe MR.\n2.

Earlier, more subtle symptoms would include exertional dyspnoea and decreased exercise tolerance, presyncope (exertional dizziness) and exertional angina.\n\nClinical examination will often reveal the following findings:\n\n- Slow rising carotid pulse\n- Narrow pulse pressure\n- Heaving, non-displaced apex beat (can be displaced if there is left ventricular hypertrophy)\n- Ejection systolic murmur\n  - Heard best at the second intercostal space on the right\n  - Can be described as \"harsh\"\n  - Transmitted well to the carotids\n- Soft S2 heart sound\n- Ejection click may be heard in some cases (early systolic)\n\n\n\n**Investigations**\n\nEchocardiography is the primary test for the diagnosis and evaluation of severity in aortic stenosis (AS).

This involves standard treatment for heart failure (ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, diuretics).\n\nPatients who do not meet the above criteria should have regular follow up, with severe AS being monitored every 6 months, mild to moderate AS monitored yearly, and younger patients can be monitored every two to three years.\n\n\n\n**Aortic sclerosis**\n\nAortic sclerosis is an asymptomatic condition that can be incidentally revealed through physical examination or via echocardiogram. It is caused by age-related senile degeneration of the valve.\n\nClassic findings are an ejection systolic murmur that _does not radiate to the carotids_, there is normal S2, pulse character and volume.\n\nIt can be defined as an irregular aortic leaflet thickening and focal increased echogenicity, but is distinguished from aortic stenosis because there is no impairment of valve leaflet excursion, and peak doppler velocities are normal or only minimally elevated (markedly elevated in stenosis)."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd27a", "topic": "Cardiology", "concept": "Pulmonary stenosis", "explanation": "Pulmonary stenosis is usually congenital, and associated with a number of syndromes:\n\n- Noonan syndrome (valvular)\n- Williams syndrome (supravalvular)\n- Tetralogy of Fallot (valvular)\n\nIt is also associated with congenital rubella infection (valvular).\n\nPulmonary stenosis can be acquired, most often (but still very infrequently) due to carcinoid syndrome.\n\nOther causes of primary pulmonary stenosis are rare.\n\nSurgical options include valvotomy (for valvular lesions) and balloon angioplasty (for supravalvular lesions) and treatment is considered in those with transvalvular pressure gradients >50mmHg."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd27b", "topic": "Cardiology", "concept": "Differentials of ejection systolic murmur", "explanation": "There are several causes of ejection systolic murmurs, which can be differentiated from each other in a number of ways.\n\n- Innocent murmurs \u2014 they are typically loudest in the pulmonary area, have a \"blowing\" quality and vary positionally (may disappear and reappear).

Dilated - most common\n2. Hypertrophic\n3. Restrictive\n4. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy\n\n\n\n**Dilated Cardiomyopathy**\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has a number of possible causes.\n\n- Ischaemic changes can over time manifest with DCM, particularly post-myocardial infarction\n- Hypertensive\n- Genetic and congenital - may be related to familial dilated cardiomyopathy, however some sporadic gene mutations may be responsible for idiopathic cases\n- Toxin-related - excessive alcohol consumption leads to myocardial dysfunction and subsequent DCM. Cocaine is also associated with ischaemia and DCM. Other medications which lead to cardiomyopathy include anthracycline chemotherapy (Doxorubicin), Cyclophosphamide, antiretroviral drugs (Zidovudine), Chloroquine and Clozapine.\n- Infiltrative - haemochromatosis, amyloidosis and sarcoidosis are known to cause DCM\n- Peripartum - a rare cause of DCM, with unclear aetiology\n- Thyrotoxicosis - the exact mechanism of this is uncertain, but thought to be related to the effects of thyroid hormone on cardiac function\n- Infectious - DCM can occur secondary to myocarditis, or as a direct result of infection from HIV, Lyme disease and Chagas disease\n- Stress induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) refers to transient left ventricular ballooning precipitated by intense psychologic stress. Almost all patients recover completely\n- Idiopathic - when other potential causes have been ruled out\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy is characterised by dilation and poor contraction of either the left ventricle, or both ventricles (ejection fraction < 40%).\n\nMost patients present between the third and sixth decades of life, and can present in a number of different ways.\n\nThe most common symptoms are those related to heart failure (exertional dyspnoea, orthopneoa, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and peripheral oedema). Other symptoms relate to consequences of the cardiomyopathy, such as arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia), conduction disturbances or sudden cardiac death.\n\nExamination findings include a displaced apex beat, S3 gallop rhythm (rapid ventricular filling), murmur of mitral regurgitation (due to displacement of the valve leaflets), and symptoms of heart failure (such as oedema, hepatomegaly, ascites, raised JVP).\n\nECG may show poor R-wave progression. Echocardiography is diagnostic.\n\n\n\n**Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic condition characterised by left ventricular hypertrophy of varying degrees. \n\nThe condition arises as a result of a mutation in one of several myocyte sarcomere genes such as myosin and troponin, causing myocyte hypertrophy and disarray.\n\nInheritance is autosomal dominant, however half of cases are as a result of sporadic mutations where the parents do not carry a disease-causing mutation.\n\nIts prevalence is approximately 1 in 500 adults.\n\nMost of the hypertrophy develops during the childhood and adolescent period, however genetic variation means some late onset disease does occur.\n\nThe abnormal morphology of the left ventricle can cause severe consequences such as:\n\n- Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO)\n- Diastolic dysfunction\n- Ischaemia\n- Mitral regurgitation\n\n\n\nMany patients have little to no symptoms and the initial presenting condition can sometimes be presyncope, syncope or sudden death.

These cases might not respond to (or need) conventional treatment.\n\n \n\n**Presentation:**\n\n- Chest pain - the classical presentation can be considered in terms of the SOCRATES mnemonic:\n  - Site - Central/left sided\n  - Onset - Often sudden\n  - Character - Crushing ('like someone is sitting on your chest')\n  - Radiation - Left arm, neck and jaw\n  - Associated symptoms - Nausea, sweating, clamminess, shortness of breath, sometimes vomiting or syncope\n  - Timing - Constant\n  - Exacerbating/relieving factors - Worsened by exercise/exertion and may be improved by GTN\n  - Severity - Often extremely severe\n- Atypical presentations may include:\n  - Epigastric pain\n  - No pain (more common in elderly and diabetics):\n    - Acute breathlessness\n    - Palpitations\n    - Acute confusion\n    - Diabetic hyperglycaemic crises\n    - Syncope \n\n\n\nIt is important to remember that there are non-MI causes of chest pain and these should be considered when making a diagnosis:\n\n- Cardiac\n  - Myocarditis\n  - Pericarditis\n  - Cardiomyopathy\n  - Valvular disease\n  - Cardiac trauma\n- Pulmonary\n  - PE\n  - Pneumonia\n  - Pneumothorax\n- Vascular\n  - Aortic dissection\n- GI\n  - Oesophageal spasm\n  - Oesophagitis\n  - Peptic ulcer\n  - Pancreatitis\n  - Cholecystitis\n- MSK\n  - Rib fracture\n  - Costochondritis\n  - Muscle injury\n  - Herpes zoster\n\n\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n\nDiagnosis depends on a combination of clinical, ECG and biochemical findings which helps distinguish between the various types of ACS.\n\n- Unstable angina  - Cardiac chest pain + abnormal/normal ECG + **normal troponin**\n- NSTEMI - Cardiac chest pain + abnormal/normal ECG (but not ST-elevation) + **raised troponin**\n- STEMI - Cardiac chest pain + **Persistent ST-elevation/new LBBB** (note that there is no need for a troponin in this case)\n\n\n\nDiagnosis of STEMI:\n\n- ST segment elevation **>1mm** in adjacent chest leads\n- ST segment elevation **>2mm** in adjacent limb leads\n- New left bundle branch block (LBBB) with chest pain or suspicion of MI\n\n\n\nDiagnosis of NSTEMI requires two of the following:\n\n- Cardiac chest pain\n- Newly abnormal ECG which is NOT ST-elevation\n- Raised troponin (with no other reasonable explanation)\n\n\n\nWhen presented with a patient who may be suffering from an MI the following immediate investigations are of use:\n\n- ECG - looking for ST-elevation, LBBB or other ST abnormalities\n\n  - This is the most important investigation and should not be delayed for other investigations (e.g. bloods) because this will define immediate management.\n  - If an ECG shows STEMI then troponin is essentially irrelevant and the patient requires immediate treatment.\n\n- Bloods:\n\n  - Troponin - performed **at least 3 hours** after pain starts.\n\n    - It may also need to be repeated 6-12 hours after the start of pain if the initial result is equivocal.\n\n  - Renal function\n\n  - Blood glucose\n\n  - Lipid profile\n\n  - FBC and CRP - rule out infectious causes of chest pain\n\n  - D-dimer - may be used in *appropriate* patients to rule out PE\n\n  - Chest x-ray - looking for pulmonary causes of chest pain or pulmonary oedema (as a complication of MI)\n\n    \n\n*Interpretation of ECG*s\n\nThe importance of a 12-lead ECG is that it allows one to view electrical activity of the heart from different \"views\". In MI (particularly STEMI) this allows you to understand which territory (and therefore vessel) is being affected.\n\n| Location of ST elevation   | Area of myocardium | Coronary artery      |\n| -------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |\n| II, III, aVF               | Inferior           | RCA                  |\n| V1-2                       | Septal             | Proximal LAD         |\n| V3-4                       | Anterior           | LAD                  |\n| V5-6                       | Apex               | Distal LAD/ LCx/ RCA |\n| I, aVL                     | Lateral            | Lcx                  |\n| V7-V9 (ST depression V1-3) | Posterolateral     | RCA/ LCx             |\n\nRCA: right coronary artery, LAD: left anterior descending, LCx: Left circumflex\n\nNSTEMIs may also show T wave abnormalities (such as inversions) in vascular territories as above. However changes can also often not include all the specific leads for territory in NSTEMI.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Interpretation of troponin*\n\nTroponin is a myocardial protein released into the bloodstream when cardiac myocytes are damaged. Serum levels typically rise **3 hours** after myocardial infarction begins.\n\nDifferent hospitals have differing guidelines (and assays) for interpretations of results. In general there are three groups of troponin levels:\n\n- Low - definitely no myocardial cell death. The patient is not having an MI although they may be experiencing unstable angina.\n- Mildly raised - This is an equivocal result and may be due to other non-MI related factors (see below). These patients usually need a <u>6-12 hour repeat test</u>. \n  - If repeat troponin is raised on the repeat they are having an MI.\n  - If repeat troponin is stable or falling then they are unlikely to be having an MI.\n- Definitely raised - MI confirmed (be aware of the possibility of a Type 2 MI)\n\nAlthough troponin is often used diagnose myocardial infarction, there are in fact many causes of a raised troponin:\n\n- Myocardial infarction\n- Pericarditis\n- Myocarditis\n- Arrythmias\n- Defibrillation\n- Acute heart failure\n- Pulmonary embolus\n- Type A aortic dissection\n- Chronic kidney disease\n- Prolonged strenuous exercise\n- Sepsis\n\nIt is therefore critical to have good clinical grounds to test a troponin in order to avoid unnecessary treatments and investigations.\n\n\n\n**Management:**\n\nAcute management depends on the type of MI.\n\n*Management of STEMI:*\n\n1. Targeted oxygen therapy (aiming for sats >94%)\n2. Loading dose of **PO aspirin 300mg**\n   - Note that some hospital protocols will also call for a loading dose of a second anti-platelet agent such as clopidogrel (300mg) or ticagrelor (180mg)\n3. **Sublingual GTN spray** - for symptom relief\n4. **IV morphine/diamorphine** - in addition this causes vasodilation reducing preload on the heart\n5. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) for those who:\n   - Present **within 12 hours of onset of pain** AND\n   - Are **<2 hours** since <u>first medical contact</u>  \n\nRemember that (particularly in STEMI) *time is heart* therefore urgent treatment, escalation and delivery of PPCI is critical to good outcomes.\n\n\n\n*Management of NSTEMI:*\n\n1. Targeted oxygen therapy (aiming for sats >94%)\n2. Loading dose of **PO aspirin 300mg**\n   - Patients should have their 6 month mortality score (often the GRACE score) calculated as early as possible - all those who are anything other than lowest risk should also be given **PO clopidogrel 300mg**\n     - Other adjunct anti-platelets (used instead of clopidogrel) are Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors such as **eptifibatide** or **tirofiban** and are used in high risk patients.\n3. **Sublingual GTN spray** - for symptom relief\n4. **IV morphine/diamorphine** - in addition this causes vasodilation reducing preload on the heart\n5. Start antithrombin therapy such as **treatment dose low molecular weight heparin** or **fondaparinux**\n6. Patients with <u>high 6 month risk of mortality</u> should be offered an angiogram within 96 hours of symptom onset.\n7. Those at high risk should be offered early angiography (within 96 hours of symptoms onset)\n\nNote that management of unstable angina is similar to that of NSTEMI with aspirin for all patients and clopidogrel and early angiography for those at high risk.\n\n\n\n*Post-MI management:*\n\n- ALL patients post-MI patients should be started on the following four drugs:\n  1. **Aspirin 75mg OM**\n  2. **Beta blocker (normally bisoprolol)**\n  3. **ACE-inhibitor (normally ramipril)**\n  4. **High dose statin (e.g. Atorvastatin 80mg ON)**\n- Along with this ,anybody who has had a stent inserted will need to be on *dual antiplatelet therapy* for at **least 1 year** (to avoid stent thrombosis) which normally involves the addition of <u>clopidogrel 7mg OD</u> or <u>ticagrelor 90mg OD</u> on top of the aspirin.\n- All patients should have an **ECHO** performed to assess systolic function and any evidence of heart failure should be treated.\n- All patients should be referred to **cardiac rehabilitation**.\n- Patients  who have been treated without angiography should be considered for ischaemia testing to assess for inducible ischaemia.\n\n\n\n**Complications of MI**\n\nComplications of MI include:\n\n- Ventricular arrhythmia\n- Recurrent ischaemia/infarction/angina\n- Acute mitral regurgitation\n- Congestive heart failure\n- 2nd, 3rd degree heart block\n- Cardiogenic shock\n- Cardiac tamponade\n- Ventricular septal defects\n- Left ventricular thrombus/aneurysm\n- Left/right ventricular free wall rupture\n- Dressler's Syndrome\n- Acute pericarditis\n\n\n\n*Ventricular Arrhythmias*\n\n- Ventricular arrhythmias can occur as a consequence of MI, during cardiac catheterisation or after reperfusion.\n- Most post-MI ventricular arrhythmias are short lived and self-resolve.\n- However if sustained VT or VF occurs they should be treated as ALS protocols.\n\n\n\n*Recurrent ischaemia/infarction/angina*\n\n- Occasionally inserted stents can thrombose requiring reintervention.\n- New infarcts can occur in different vascular territories - this is less likely in the age of PCI where all territory are imaged during the procedure.\n- Angina and chest pain can continue for some time after an MI and is more common in NSTEMI patients.\n\n\n\n*Congestive heart failure*\n\n- Heart failure can occur as a consequence of impairment heart muscle function secondary to ischaemia.\n- It should be treated as any other acute heart failure.\n- Ventricular function may improve over months as the heart muscle recovers.\n\n\n\n*Heart block*\n\n- Various levels of heart block are common - particularly following **inferior** infarcts (because the right coronary artery supplies the SA node).\n- These may be treated with:\n  - Simple observation (as many will revert back to sinus rhythm)\n  - Transcutaneous/venous pacing (if symptomatic)\n  - Permanent pacing (if failing to resolve)\n\n\n\n*Left ventricular thrombus/aneurysm*\n\n- Aneurysm can occur following an anterior MI where the myocardium can be susceptible to wall stress leading to an aneurysm.\n- It may be silent, cause arrhythmias or embolic events.\n- It is definitely diagnosed on ECHO but ECG may show persisting ST elevation.\n- Thrombus can form either within an above described aneurysm or around hypokinetic regions of the myocardium.\n- Thrombi can embolise causing complicaitons such as stroke, acute limb ischaemia and mesenteric ischaemia.\n\n\n\n*Left/right ventricular free wall rupture*\n\n- Necrosis of the free walls of either ventricle can lead to rupture allowing blood into the pericardial space.\n- This leads to a rapid tamponade and normally leads to cardiac arrest/death within seconds.\n- Treatment includes pericardiocentesis and surgery but prognosis is extremely poor.\n\n\n\n*Acute mitral regurgitation*\n\n- This can occur because of papillary muscle rupture and carries a poor prognosis.\n- This presents with:\n  - Pansystolic murmur heard best at the apex\n  - Severe and sudden heart failure\n- It is diagnosed on ECHO and may require surgical correction.\n\n\n\n*Ventricular septal defect*\n\n- Interventricular septal rupture is a short-term complications of myocardial infarction.\n- Rupture caused by an anterior infarct is generally apical and simple.\n- Rupture caused by an inferior infarct is generally basal and more complex.\n- Without reperfusion, septal rupture typically occurs within the first week after the infarction.\n- Features of septal rupture include: \n  - Shortness of breath\n  - Chest pain\n  - Heart failure\n  - Hypotension\n  - Harsh, loud pan-systolic murmur along the left sternal border.\n  - Palpable parasternal thrill.\n- Diagnosis is with echocardiogram.\n- Patients are managed with emergency cardiac surgery.\n\n\n\n*Dressler's syndrome*\n\n- Dressler's syndrome or post-infarction pericarditis typically presents with persistent fever and pleuritic chest pain **2-3 weeks** or up to a few months after an MI.\n- Note that patients can get pericarditis immediately following MI which is NOT considered Dressler's syndrome.\n- Symptoms usually resolve after several days. \n- Occasionally it can also present with features of pericardial effusion and has become relatively uncommon since the introduction of PCI. \n- Management:\n  1.

Muscle biopsy can provide a definitive diagnosis.\n\n\n**Dermatomyositis**\n\nDermatomyositis causes the above muscular features of polymyositis with additional skin rashes, including any of the following (in rough order of frequency):\n\n- Heliotrope rash -which is a lilac discolouration of the eyelid skin in addition to periorbital oedema\n\n- Gottron's papules which are scaly, erythematous papules over knuckles and extensor surfaces of knees and elbows\n\n- Macular erythematous rash generally found on the head and neck, trunk or hands\n\n- Periungual (nailfold) erythema\n\n- Cutaneous vasculitis which can present as rashes and lead to ulcers\n\n- Calcinosis\n\n\n\n**Extra-muscular features**\n\nThe following may occur in either poly or dermatomyositis:\n\n- Systemic upset (fever / tiredness / malaise / weight loss)\n\n- Joints  (polyarthralgia)\n\n- Pulmonary (interstitial lung disease)\n\n- Cardiovascular (Raynaud's phenomenon and myocarditis)\n\n\n\n**Association with malignancy**\n\n5-15% of cases of poly/dermatomyositis are secondary to an underlying malignancy and should be looked for, especially in dermatomyositis as the association is much stronger than for polymyositis.

Although DIL can present with any feature of SLE, the most common features are:\n\n- Systemic upset (fever / fatigue / myalgia).\n- Arthritis (non-erosive) or arthralgia.\n- Serositis in the form of pleurisy or pericarditis.\n\nDermatological features of SLE such as the characteristic malar rash are less common in DIL, and SLE renal disease (the most common cause of death in SLE) and neurological involvement are rare.\n\nWhile SLE usually occurs in females, DIL occurs in males and females equally.\n\n\n\n*Relation to medication:*\n\nDrugs that are definitely known to cause drug induced lupus (DIL) include:\n\n- Sulfadiazine.\n\n- Hydralazine.\n\n- Procainamide.\n\n- Isoniazid.\n\n- Methyldopa.\n\n- Quinidine.\n\n- Minocycline\n\n- Chlorpromazine.\n\n\n**Investigations:**\n\nBlood tests:\n\n- DIL patients may be positive for ANA, but they should not be positive for the SLE specific autoantibodies Anti-dsDNA and Anti-sm.\n- They may be positive for Anti-histone however, which is considered specific for DIL.\n- Inflammatory markers may be raised.\n\n\n\n**Initial tests that should be performed in a patient with suspected SLE:**\n\n* FBC and clotting screen - a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) would suggest the presence of lupus anticoagulant and should prompt checking of anti-phospholipid antibodies. SLE patients often have anaemia of chronic disease, but can also have haemolytic anaemia.\n* U+Es and urinalysis - to screen for renal involvement\n* ESR and CRP - suggestive of active disease (in the absence of infection)\n* Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) - antibody to double stranded DNA (Anti-dsDNA) and Anti-Smith antigen.\n\nA positive ANA in itself is not diagnostic as it can occur in other connective tissue diseases. Anti-dsDNA and anti-Smith antibodies are highly specific for SLE and often are confirmatory of the diagnosis. High titres of anti-dsDNA antibodies are markers of disease activity and correlate to worse outcome in lupus nephritis.\n\n**Other investigations will depend on system involvement, and as SLE is a multi-system disease may include the following:**\n\n- CXR should be performed in all patients presenting with cardiopulmonary symptoms\n- Pulmonary function tests show a restrictive pattern\n- Pleural aspiration may be performed in patients to identify cause of pleural effusion and shows exudate\n- Complement levels in active disease will show low C3 and C4\n- Renal ultrasound may be carried out in patients with renal involvement to exclude other causes of renal impairment\n- Renal biopsy is the most sensitive and specific test for lupus nephritis\n- Plain X rays of affected joints show inflammation and non erosive arthritis in patients with joint manifestations\n- Brain MRI may be done in patients with suspected cerebral lupus\n- Echocardiogram can show pericarditis, pericardial effusion, pulmonary hypertension\n\nSerological findings in SLE include:\n\n* Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are sensitive but not specific\n* Anti-dsDNA antibodies are specific and predict a poor prognosis with renal disease\n\nOther antibodies that may be seen in SLE include:\n\n* Anti-Smith antibodies are antibodies directed against snRNPs, and are specific but not prognostic\n* Anti-histone antibodies are sensitive for drug-induced lupus\n* Anti-cardiolipin antibodies, which also trigger false-positive results on syphilis testing, and lead to a prolonged PTT\n* Decreased C3, C4, and CH50 due to immune complex formation\n\n\n\n**Diagnostic Criteria**\n\nThe large number of potential symptoms can be difficult to remember, but the mnemonic **A RASH POINts MD** can help to remember the American College of Rheumatology Diagnostic Criteria and thus the important symptoms and investigations - presence of \u22654 supports the diagnosis:\n\n- **A**rthritis / arthralgia.\n- **R**enal disease.\n- **A**NA positive.\n- **S**erositis (pericarditis / pleurisy / pleural effusion).\n- **H**aematological (haemolysis / low WCC / platelets / lymphocytes).\n- **P**hotosensitivity rash.\n- **O**ral ulcers.\n- **I**mmunological tests positive (anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, anti-phospholipid).\n- **N**europsychiatric (seizures, psychosis).\n- **M**alar rash.\n- **D**iscoid rash.\n\nNote: There is now a move towards using the SLICC Classification Criteria for SLE.

Cyclophosphamide is effective and is the usual choice.\n\n*Adjuvant therapy*\n\nRenal disease:\n\n- Monitoring blood pressure and urinalysis (proteinuria or haematuria) to detect lupus nephritis early is essential. Hypertension should be treated aggressively, usually with ACE-inhibitors. Full renal failure will require corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide.\n\nThrombocytopenia or leucopoenia:\n\n- IV immunoglobulin infusions may be beneficial.\n\nAntiphospholipid syndrome:\n\n- Antiplatelets or anticoagulation.\n\nSeizures:\n\n- Anti-epileptic medication may be needed.\n\n\n\n**Emergencies in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus**\n\n*Lupus Glomerulonephritis*\n\nMany patients have chronic symptoms and the symptoms of an emergency (like Lupus Glomerulonephritis) may be subtle to spot. If Lupus Glomerulonephritis is untreated, patients will develop renal damage. This is the reason why all patients with SLE have a urine dipstick test to assess for proteinuria. If it is frankly nephrotic (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and oedema), an urgent admission is required. The mainstay of treatment is high dose steroids plus immunosuppression.\n\n*Cerebral Lupus*\n\nCerebral Lupus can have many different presentations. Patients can present with fits, psychosis, severe unremitting headaches or impairment of consciousness. Patients will often have other signs of active SLE disease. It is often difficult to distinguish the mild cases of Cerebral Lupus from depression or infection. The ESR and anti ds-DNA antibody titres will be raised whereas the complement C3 and C4 levels will be low. The C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels will often not be markedly raised. Sometimes, the blood markers of active SLE disease and the MRI scan can be normal. The management of Cerebral Lupus consists of high dose steroids and immunosuppression (Cyclophosphamide/Azathioprine).

A rash that includes the tip of the nose indicates that the reactivation includes the nasociliary nerve and an urgent ophthalmology review is necessary. This is known as Hutchinson's sign.

It is associated with significant morbidity which can be minimised if diagnosed and treated early. It is more common in women and peak incidence is 40-50 years old.\n\n**Presentation:**\n\n*Arthritis:*\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) classically presents as a symmetrical, polyarticular inflammatory arthritis involving the small joints of the hands (metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints), wrists, and feet, with other joints becoming involved later as the disease progresses. The distal interphalangeal joints (distal interphalangeal joints) are usually spared in RA however, which can help differentiate it from psoriatic arthritis which can present in a very similar fashion.\n\nJoint pattern involvement in rheumatoid arthritis is very variable however, and can take almost any form, including an acute monoarthritis and palindromic rheumatism, which causes recurrent, short lived (hours to days) episodes of arthritis in different joints before settling into a more permanent form.\n\nThe pain is inflammatory and as such is usually better with movement and associated with prolonged early morning stiffness (>30 min). Joints are swollen, red, warm, and tender on examination.\n\nRA has a gradual onset over days to weeks and is considerably more common in females (3:1) and smokers, and the peak onset is in 40-60 year olds. \n\n\n\n*Deformities:*\n\nJoint inflammation in RA can damage tendons, ligaments and the joint capsule, creating characteristic deformities on examination.\n\nHands:\n\n- Wrist subluxation.\n- Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) subluxation.\n- Swan-neck finger deformity (MCP flexion, PIP hyperextension, DIP hyperflexion).\n- Boutonniere finger deformity (PIP flexion, DIP hyperextension).\n- Ulnar deviation of proximal phalanges.\n- Z-shaped thumb.\n\nFeet:\n\n- Hallux valgus.\n- Hammer toes.\n- MTP subluxation.\n\nOccasionally extensor tendons of the hands and feet may rupture and require prompt surgical repair to maintain their function.\n\n\n\n*C-spine involvement:*\n\nUnlike the seronegative spondylarthropathies, where lower back pain can be a prominent feature, RA typically spares the lumbar (and thoracic) spine, but can instead can involve the cervical spine, in particular, the atlanto-axial joint (C1-C2).\n\nAs the stabilising ligaments of the joint are damaged, instability and subluxation of the atlanto-axial joint can occur. This classically causes neck pain radiating to the occiput but can also cause a myelopathy resulting in weakness and altered sensation in the upper limbs (though this can be confused with other issues in RA such as muscle weakness and peripheral neuropathies).\n\nMinor neck trauma in these patients can worsen a subluxation, and even cause upwards migration of the odontoid peg through the foramen magnum, resulting in spinal cord compression, compression of vertebral arteries, and even sudden death.\n\nC-spine imaging should be performed in any RA patient thought to be at risk. Usually a plain film will suffice and is often requested by anaesthetics pre-operatively as airway manoeuvres could worsen any existing disease.\n\nC-spine disease is usually treated surgically.\n\n\n\n*Peri-articular features:*\n\n- Carpal tunnel syndrome \u2013 causing pain, weakness and paraesthesia in the median nerve distribution of the hand.\n\n- Tenosynovitis \u2013 typically of the flexor tendons in the hands, causing pain and swelling.\n\n- Bursitis \u2013 typically of the olecranon (elbow) and sub-acromial (shoulder) bursae, causing pain and swelling. \n\n\n*Extra-articular features:*\nRA is a multisystem inflammatory disease and can affect most organs.\n\nGeneral:\nPatients often feel generally unwell with RA, including low grade fevers, weight loss, and fatigue.\n\nHaematological:\n\n- Anaemia of chronic disease - this is common in RA (note that most DMARDs can also cause cytopenias as a side effect).\n- Splenomegaly including Felty's syndrome (triad of RA, splenomegaly and neutropenia).\n- Amyloidosis \u2013 most organs can be affected, classically the kidneys causing nephrotic syndrome.\n- Generalised lymphadenopathy.\n\nDermatological:\n\n- Rheumatoid nodules (firm, dark skin nodules, usually around sites of inflammation).\n- Small vessel vasculitis causing nailbed infarcts and arterial leg ulcers.\n- Raynaud's syndrome.\n\nOphthalmic:\n\n- Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes) \u2013 this can occur on its own, or as part of secondary Sjogren's syndrome with oral, genital and gastric ulcers.\n- Episcleritis and scleritis.\n\nRespiratory\n\n- Pleural effusions containing rheumatoid factor.\n- Rheumatoid nodules may be seen on chest x-ray, and are asymptomatic.\n- Pneumonitis leading to pulmonary fibrosis (note that this can also be a side effect of methotrexate).\n\nOrthopaedic:\n\n- Osteoporosis.\n\nCardiac:\n\n- Pericardial effusions containing rheumatoid factor.\n- Strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\n\nNeurological:\n\n- Peripheral neuropathy.\n\n\n\n**Investigations:**\n\nBlood tests:\n\n- FBC \u2013 anaemia of chronic disease is common.\n\n- Inflammatory markers \u2013 these are raised and can be used to monitor disease severity.\n\n- Rheumatoid factor (RF) - considered specific for rheumatoid arthritis and can help support the diagnosis, though does not confirm it, and is present in 1% of the normal population. RA patients that are RF positive tend to have more systemic involvement and a worse prognosis.\n\n- Anti-CCP \u2013 A positive anti-CCP is even more specific than RF for rheumatoid arthritis and can support the diagnosis, though does not confirm it.\n\n\nRadiology:\n\nJoint x-rays are often normal initially but later have the following typical features:\n\n- Soft tissue swelling\n- Periarticular osteoporosis.\n- Juxta-articular erosions.\n- Narrowing of joint space.\n\n\n\n**Treatment:**\n\nTreatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be divided into symptomatic relief and disease modifying treatment.\n\nDisease severity and the efficacy of treatment is often monitored using the DAS28 score, which includes CRP or ESR, the number of swollen or tender joints, and a patient questionnaire.\n\nThere are local protocols in place to guide therapy decisions. DAS scores below 2.6 indicate remission (i.e. free from symptoms). DAS scores between 2.6 to 3.2 indicate low disease whereas scores between 3.2 to 5.1 indicate moderate disease levels. DAS scores above 5.1 indicate high disease levels. Local protocols are in place to guide therapy decisions in patients with low or moderate  or high disease activity levels.\n\n\n\n*Symptomatic relief*\n\nPharmacological:\n\n* Regular paracetamol and NSAIDs are the mainstay of reducing pain, swelling and stiffness.\n* During flares, intra-articular or a course of oral steroids can be given.\n\nMDT:\n\n* Physiotherapy - exercise prescription to help maintain muscle strength around the joint and thus range of movement\n* Occupational therapy - provide advice and physical aids to avoid putting stress on joints during daily activities. Note - during acute flares, occupational therapists can also apply splints to joints.\n\nSurgery:\nSurgery is usually reserved for severely damaged joints and may include joint arthroplasty, fusion or synovectomy\n\n\n\n**Disease Modifying Treatment**: Disease modifying treatment actually slows the progression of the disease and joint destruction. They are indicated if the DAS28 (symptom severity) score is >5.1\n\nDisease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs):\n- DMARDs include a number of immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide.\n- Current recommendations are to give DMARD monotherapy as first-line with the addition of a second DMARD if remission is not achieved.\n- It is very important to commence DMARDs as early as possible after symptoms occur, ideally within 3 months.\n- DMARDs can take several weeks to produce a response, and can cause mild immunosuppression as well as a number of important side effects which are unique to each drug.\n\nBiologics:\n\n* A biologic inhibits a specific target in the immune system thought to drive inflammation in RA. The most common are anti-TNF agents such as infliximab.\n* Biologics are only used when the disease severity is severe (DAS28 > 5.1) despite long-term combination DMARD therapy. They are usually taken *in addition to* DMARDs.\n* Biologics are expensive and have important side effects, most notably immunosuppression - they are usually discontinued if the patient does not see a significant improvement.\n\nFor patients on disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, it is recommended that they receive the annual Influenza vaccine and the Pneumococcal vaccine every 5 years as per the schedule. Both vaccines are not live. In patients taking more potent biological drugs or higher doses of corticosteroids, the zoster vaccine is not recommended.\n\n*Cardiovascular risk factors*\nRA is a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Patients should therefore have their cardiovascular risk closely monitored and treated by their GP.\n\n\n\n**Pregnancy**\n\nA washout period of at least three months pre-conception is required for patients on Methotrexate who are planning on starting a family. Methotrexate should be avoided during pregnancy due to the risk of teratogenicity. If a patient does become pregnant while on Methotrexate, she should be referred to the foetal medicine specialist. In a planned pregnancy, a washout procedure should be completed for patients on Leflunomide and Leflunomide should be avoided in pregnancy. Whilst patients often do not have disease flares during pregnancy, it is more common for patients to experience disease flares in the postpartum period.  If the disease is mild, simple analgesia with Paracetamol with a weak opioid can be sufficient. Low dose Prednisolone can be added to control flares in disease activity along with joint injections. Hydroxychloroquine and/or Sulfasalazine with concomitant Folic Acid can be continued during pregnancy. These medications should be initiated and monitored by the Rheumatology team."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd2a7", "topic": "Rheumatology", "concept": "Side effects of corticosteroids", "explanation": "Corticosteroids are powerful immunosuppressants but their long-term use is avoided where possible due to their very high side effect profile. \n\nThey should be used at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time, but in some cases their long-term use cannot be avoided.\n\n**Adrenal suppression**\n\nPerhaps the most important side effect to bear in mind when dealing with steroids is adrenal suppression:\n* If exogenous steroids are taken long-term the adrenal gland stops producing adequate levels of endogenous cortisol.\n* If exogenous steroids are then stopped suddenly adrenal insufficiency can occur.\n* In serious cases this can lead to shock, typically seen as *hyper*kalaemic *hypo*tension. The management for this is to give more steroids usually as IV hydrocortisone.\n* Adrenal insufficiency can also occur during intercurrent acute illnesses as the body normally increases the production of cortisol in illness but cannot do this during steroid therapy as the adrenal axis is suppressed.\n\nThe following measures should be taken to avoid adrenal insufficiency:\n\n* If they are taken for less than 3 weeks steroids can be safely stopped abruptly.\n* If taken for longer than this, the steroids must be tapered down slowly.\n* 'Sick day rules' - if acutely unwell double the usual dose of prednisolone or supplement IV hydrocortisone (usually 100mg 6-hourly) if unable to tolerate oral medication.\n* If nil-by-mouth (or vomiting prednisolone before it can be absorbed), convert the increased daily dose of prednisolone to the equivalent IV hydrocortisone.\n\n**Immunosuppression:**\n\n* **Reactivation of latent infections (TB / Hepatitis B/C / Herpes viruses)**\n  * Have a low threshold for CXR to detect latent tuberculosis.\n  * If known to suffer with cold sores or shingles start high-dose acyclovir at the earliest sign.\n* **Raised risk of new infections:**\n  * Any infection but particularly opportunistic ones such as candida.\n  * Infections are also generally worse but with potential masking of localising symptoms thus it is important to have low threshold for cultures.\n\nNotes on viruses:\nIf not already immune from childhood immunisation or infection chickenpox or measles can be contracted and these patients have a higher risk of serious complications of these infections. Patients must avoid exposure to anyone displaying symptoms. Aciclovir and varicella zoster immunoglobulin can be given if chickenpox exposure occurs.\nLive vaccinations are **contra-indicated**.\n\n**Other side effects:**\n\nThe long list of side effects of corticosteroids may seem overwhelming, it is easier to simply go through them by system:\n\nDermatological / appearance:\n\n* Cushingoid appearance  with central obesity, buffalo hump, moon face.\n* Acne.\n* Thinned skin with striae.\n\nEndocrine:\n\n* Hyperglycaemia.\n* Cushing's disease - *Hypo*kalaemic *hyper*tension with fluid and Na+ retention.\n* Growth retardation in children.\n\nMusculoskeletal:\n\n* Osteoporosis.\n* Muscle wasting.\n\nPsychiatric:\n\n* Mood swings.\n* Worsening of underlying psychiatric condition.\n* Can cause full steroid psychosis soon after administering.\n\nGI:\n\n* Dyspepsia.\n\nOphthalmic:\n\n* Glaucoma.\n* Cataracts.\n\nHaematological:\n* Raised white cell count."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd2a8", "topic": "Rheumatology", "concept": "Systemic sclerosis", "explanation": "**Overview**\n\nThe most recognisable feature of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is skin fibrosis, but a number of other organs can be affected.\n\nSystemic sclerosis can take 2 forms:\n\n1. **Limited** cutaneous systemic sclerosis\n  * Skin fibrosis is *limited* to the hands and forearms, feet and legs, and the head and neck.\n  * It is also known as CREST syndrome, because while any feature of diffuse cutaneous SSc can occur they primarily consist of the following:\n    *  **C**alcinosis\n    *  **R**aynaud's phenomenon\n    *  o**E**sophageal dysmotility - dysphagia/GORD\n    *  **S**clerodactyly - bright shiny skin of hands and feet consistent with sclerodactyly.

In the initial stages they may appear inflamed (red/purple, puffy, itchy or painful) before settling into a more fibrosed state with the following features:\n\n* Loss of normal skin creases.\n* Hypo or hyper pigmented or shiny.\n* Flexion contractures if overlying joints.\n\nOther skin features include:\n\n* Sclerodactyly - thickening and contracture of an entire digit.\n* Microstomia - restricted mouth opening, often with skin furrowing.\n* Telangiectasia - small non-blanching red dots, often around the mouth.\n* Calcinosis.\n\nIn *limited* cutaneous SSc, these lesions are limited to the hands and forearms, feet and legs, and the head and neck, whereas they can occur anywhere in diffuse.\n\n\n\n*Joints*\n\nMost patients have some form of arthralgia.\n\n\n\n*Cardiovascular*\n\n* The vast majority of patients experience Raynaud's phenomenon.\n\n* Pericarditis.\n\n* Myocardial fibrosis which can cause heart failure and arrhythmias.\n\n\n*GI*\n\n* Oesophageal dysmotility.

A pathologist looks at prostatic tissue under a microscope and then grades the morphology of the cells from 1 to 5:\n\n1. Normal tissue, well differentiated cells that are small and uniform \n2. Increased stroma between glands\n3. Distinctly infiltrative margins, moderately differentiated cells\n4. Irregular masses of neoplastic glands. Poorly differentiated \n5. Occasional gland formation seen. Very poorly differentiated \n\nThe Gleason score is made up to two numbers A & B followed by a number which is the sum of A+B, for example 3+4 = 7. The value A is the most prominent morphology seen by the pathologist, whilst B is the second most prominent morphology. \n\nThe grade of prostate cancer is of prognostic value and will influence the treatment decisions. A low Gleason score carries a better prognosis and requires intervention less often than a higher Gleason score which acts more aggressively.\n\n**Management options in prostate cancer (non-hormonal)**\n\n**Active surveillance** \n\nThis is suitable for people with low grade prostate cancer and involves repeating investigations such as PSA, DR and biopsies over a number of years. If the cancers grade or stage increases, then the clinician and patient can reassess their treatment options. This option reduces the chances of over treating patients.\n\n**Radiotherapy**\n\nRadiotherapy can be either curative or palliative. In palliation it can help reduce the tumour bulk as well as reduce pain of bony metastasis. Complications include:\n\nLocal effects:\n\n* Bowel fibrosis\n* Bladder fibrosis\n* Radiation cystitis\n* Diarrhoea\n\nSystemic effects:\n\n* Nausea\n* Tiredness\n* Loss of hair in treatment area\n\n**Surgery**\n\nThis involves removing the prostate and any affected organs. It's usually done with curative intent so isn't suitable for patients with distant disease. Modern techniques involve minimally invasive procedures such as the robotically assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) and are replacing more traditional methods such as open surgery. \n\nThe benefits include a reduced frequency of post-operative complications such as:\n\n* Pain\n* Atelectasis\n* Pneumonia\n* Post operative ileus\n* Prolonged hospital stay\n\n**Hormonal management of prostate cancer** \n\nHormonal therapy is used for patients with metastatic disease. The activity of prostate cancer depends on circulating levels of testosterone, so reducing testosterone levels can help reduce the symptoms of metastatic prostate cancer such as pain. \n\nGnRH analogues\n\nThese paradoxically result LH & FSH blockade at the pituitary by causing over stimulation. Problems caused by this are a transient increase in testosterone before the blockage which can increase the disease activity. Examples include: Goserelin and Leuprolide \n\nAndrogen antagonists\n\nThese can be offered in addition to GnRH analogues to prevent an increase in disease activity following a transient surge in LH & FSH. Examples include: Bicalutamide and Enzalutamide.\n\nGnRH antagonists\n\nThese block the GnRH receptors which results in decreased LH & FSH levels and thus testosterone. Examples include: Degarelix\n\nOrchidectomy\n\nThis reduces circulating testosterone by 8 hours but has been superseded by hormonal therapies.\n\n**Side effects of hormonal therapy**\n\n\nGnRH analogues, androgen antagonists, GnRH antagonists and orchidectomy all serve to reduce circulating testosterone. Side effects of this include:\n\nSexual:\n\n* Decreased labido\n* Impotence\n* Infertility\n* Gynecomastia \n\nMetabolic:\n\n* Weight gain\n* Osteoporosis\n* Diabetes\n* Ischaemic heart disease\n\nHaematological:\n\n* Anaemia\n\nGnRH analogues cause a transient increase in testosterone before LH, FSH blockage is achieved which can increase the disease activity. This can result in malignant cord compression if there is a disease in the spine. \n\nThe chances of this can be reduced by using an androgen receptor antagonist. This prevents an increase in disease activity following a transient surge in LH & FSH."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd2be", "topic": "Urology", "concept": "Bladder cancer", "explanation": "Although the exact cause of bladder cancer is not understood, as with most cancers there is though to be a complex interplay between environmental and genetic factors. \n\nThere are four main histological types of cancer, and these are individually associated with different environmental agents.\n\nTransitional cell carcinoma:\n\n* Smoking\n* Aromatic amines (rubber, dyes and chemical industry) \n* Cyclophosphamide\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma:\n\n* *Schistosoma **haematobium* \n* Long term catheterisation (10+ years)\n\nAdenocarcinoma:\n\n* Other types bladder cancer\n* Local bowel cancer\n\nSmall cell bladder cancer:\n\n* Associated with other types of bladder cancer\n\n**Clinical features of bladder cancer**\n\nVisible haematuria is bladder cancer until proven otherwise. \n\nAs with most cancers, clinical features can be separated into local and systemic features, and the extent of these depend on how advanced the cancer is.\n\nLocally bladder cancer can cause:\n\n* Painless haematuria\n* UTIs\n* hydronephrosis\n\nBladder cancer can invade adjacent structures such as the obturator nerve, causing neuropathic pain on the medial thigh.\n\nMetastatic disease typically occurs to the:\n\n* Lungs\n* Liver\n* Bone \n\nSystemic features:\n\n* Weight loss\n\n* Night sweats\n\n**Investigations in bladder cancer**\n\nA urine dip should be performed and if there's doubt over the presence of true haematuria, a lab sample can be sent to confirm the presence of red blood cells. \n\n**CT Urogram**\n\nContrast is injected into a vein which is then filtered by the kidney and excreted into the urinary collecting system.

T2 The tumour has locally invaded into the muscle of the bladder\n\n\t4. T3 The tumour has locally invaded into the perivesical fat, outside the muscular layer of the bladder. \n\t5.  T4 The tumour has invaded to adjacent local structures. These may include the abdominal wall, bowel, rectum, seminal vesicles or vagina. \n\nLymph nodes:\n\n* NX: The regional lymph nodes cannot be evaluated.\n* N0 (N plus zero): The cancer has not spread to the regional lymph nodes.\n* N1: The cancer has spread to a single regional lymph node in the pelvis.\n* N2: The cancer has spread to more than 2 regional lymph node in the pelvis.\n* N3: The cancer has spread to the common iliac lymph nodes, which are located behind the major arteries in the pelvis, above the bladder.\n\nMetastatic disease\n\n* M0: The disease has not metastasized.\n* M1: There is distant metastasis.\n\nBoth imaging modalities and pathological specimens are used to stage a disease.

Typically, only those patients who don't have significant co-morbidities and who are without metastatic disease would be offered a cystectomy. \n\nOnce the bladder has been removed, urinary diversion must take place. Options for urinary diversion include:\n\n* Ileal conduit\n\nPart of the small bowel is removed and the two free ends of small bowel re-anastomosed.

Bladder underactivity, or detrusor underactivity results in the bladder being unable to generate sufficient pressures to overcome resistance downstream. \n\n**Prostate**\n\nIn men, the prostate is the most common cause of LUTS. A prostate increased in size either from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostate cancer can narrow the prostatic urethra, thereby increasing the resistance in the lumen leading to LUTS. \n\n**Urethra**\n\nStrictures are the narrowing of the urethra and can be congenital or result from iatrogenic trauma, such as urethral instrumentation or anastomosis, or non iatrogenic trauma, such as astride injury.\n\n\n**Investigations of bladder outflow obstruction** \n\nThere are numerous investigative options of LUTS:\n\n* Urinalysis\n* DRE\n* Bladder diary\n* Urodynamics\n\nUrodynamic studies are the most definitive tests available to determine the etiology of both voiding dysfunction and lower urinary tract symptoms. \n\nIt comprises of:\n\n* Filling and storage phase\n* Voiding phase \n\nThe voiding phase allows the clinician to make a definite diagnosis of obstruction along the urinary tract since the bladder pressure and urinary flow rate can be measured, and the outlet resistance can therefore calculated.

These drugs involve relaxing the ureter.\n\nExamples include:\n\n- Tamsulosin\n- Doxazosin\n\n- Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy\n\nThis is a procedure where focussed sound waves are targeted at the stone with the aim of causing microfractures to the calculi, breaking it up and speeding up its passage. It's only appropriate if the patient is not septic with normal renal function, and the stone is visible on AXR.\n\n- Flexible ureterorenoscopy (FURNS)\n\nThis procedure involves putting a flexible endoscope into the ureter in order to visualize the stone. Stones can be removed by using a basket, or breaking it into smaller pieces using a laser.\n\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)\n\nThis involves accessing the renal pelvis via a percutaneous approach through the loin.

Evaluation of this component may include investigations such as clinical examination, sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection.\n\n- NX (lymph nodes unable to be assessed)\n- N0 (no spread to nearby nodes)\n- N1 (spread to underarm lymph nodes)\n- N2 (spread to underarm lymph nodes with sticking to other structures or spread to the lymph nodes behind the breast bone)\n- N3 (further spread to lymph nodes below or above the collarbone, or in the armpit and behind the breastbone.\n\nRecently, staging has been updated to also incorporate biological factors such as oestrogen/progesterone receptor expression and HER2 receptor status.\n\n**Metastasis** (M) describes the spread to other parts of the body. Investigations to assess metastasis may include bone scan, chest x-ray, full blood count, Liver Function Tests, calcium levels, CT chest and abdomen.\n\n- M0 (no metastasis)\n- M1 (metastasis present)\n\n**Management of Breast Cancer**\n\nManagement of breast cancer can be complex and depends on the stage and hormone receptor sensitivity of the cancer.\n\n- **Surgery:**\n  - Can be wide local excision (WLE) or mastectomy \u2013 WLE can be considered for smaller, solitary lesions which are peripherally located. It depends on there being enough breast left behind to close the wound with acceptable cosmetic results.\n  - Sentinal node biopsies are generally performed for all invasive cancers.\n  - Axillary node clearance may be necessary if there are positive nodes.\n  - Breast reconstruction can occur at the time of mastectomy or at a later date.\n- **Radiotherapy:**\n  - Almost all WLE should be offered adjuvant radiotherapy \u2013 reduces recurrence\n  - Should be offered to mastectomy patients with higher cancer stages (i.e. T3 or 4 or positive nodes)\n- **Chemotherapy:**\n  - Recommended for hormone receptor negative and HER2 over-expressing patients\n  - Sometimes neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given to downstage tumours before surgery.\n- **Biological therapy:**\n  - Trastuzumab (Herceptin) can be given to HER2 positive patients.\n  - It can also be offered as neoadjuvant therapy to downstage the tumour.\n- **Hormonal therapy:**\n  - Patients with oestrogen receptor positivity can receive _Anastrozole_ (aromatase inhibitor) if postmenopausal or _Tamoxifen_ (oestrogen receptor antagonist) if premenopausal.\n- **Bisphosphonates:**\n  - Recent data suggests that bisphosphonates reduces occurrence in node positive cancers.\n\n\n**Hormonal Therapy**\n\nThere are several hormonal drugs that can be used as adjunct therapy in hormone receptor positive breast cancer:\n\n*Tamoxifen*\n\n- Pro-drug that is metabolised into active compounds (afimoxifene and endoxifen) which are competitive oestrogen receptor antagonists,\n- Current advice is the take this for 5 years following surgical treatment of oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer for post-menopausal women. Some studies suggest that outcomes may be even better if taken for 10 years.\n- Side effects:\n  - Increased risk of DVT/PE\n  - Increased risk of endometrial cancer \u2013 the drug is a weak agonist on endometrial tissue\n  - Other inadvertent beneficial effects includes reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.\n\n*Letrozole/anastrozole*\n\n- These are aromatase inhibitors which prevent the synthesis of oestrogen.\n- Current advice is the take this for 5 years following surgical treatment of oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer for post-menopausal women.\n- Side effects:\n  - Hypo-oestrogenism \u2013 hot flushes, fatigue, osteoporosis\n\n*Trustuzamab ('Herceptin')*\n\n- A monoclonal antibody against the HER2 receptor.\n- Used for patients with HER2 receptor amplifications.\n- Given every 3 weeks for a year.\n- Side-effects:\n  - Cardiac dysfunction \u2013 including heart failure\n  - Teratogenicity\n\nTypes of Breast Cancer according to histology:\n\n- **Ductal carcinoma:**\n  - Most common form of breast tumour (75%).\n  - Abnormal proliferation of ductal cells\n  - The grade is considered higher as the ductal cells lose their acinar structure and their nuclei become abnormally large.\n  - If the basement membrane is NOT BREACHED then it is considered ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\n- **Lobular carcinoma**\n  - Makes up about 15% of breast cancers\n  - More likely to be bilateral and multi-centric\n  - Abnormal proliferation of lobular cells which arrange themselves in single rows. The cells are often <u>small, bland and uniform</u>.\n  - Due to the sparse distribution of the tumour cells they are frequently <u>impalpable</u> or not appreciable as a discrete lump.\n  - If the basement membrane is NOT BREACHED then it is considered lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). These are frequently multifocal and impalpable.\n- **Medullary carcinoma**\n  - More common in younger patients and with BRCA1 mutations.\n  - Composed of solid sheets of anaplastic cells with large pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli and frequent mitoses.\n  - There is also significant lymphocytic infiltration surrounding the tumour.\n  - Often has a better prognosis than ductal tumours.\n- **Phyllodes tumour**\n  - This is rare (1% of breast tumours)\n  - Composed of epithelial and stromal tissue which grows in a \u201cleaf-like pattern\u201d.\n- Other forms of breast tumour include mucinous, tubular, papillary and lymphoma."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd2cc", "topic": "Breast Disease", "concept": "Benign breast disease", "explanation": "The majority of patients referred for breast symptoms have benign breast disease (non-cancerous).\n\nThe following are common benign breast pathologies:\n\n- Fibroadenoma: highly mobile, encapsulated breast masses that arise from the breast lobule stroma.

It is more common in patients with a family history of the condition and patients with Anglo-Saxon descent.\n\n- Symptoms develop because of increased osteoclast activity at first and followed by increased osteoblast activity resulting in disorganised bone breakdown and formation.\n\n- In some patients, the condition eventually *burns out* and bone resorption and formation reduces, leaving an abnormal bone structure which is composed of a mixture of lamellar and woven bone.\n\n- Patients are often asymptomatic and diagnosis is incidental upon noticing an abnormally shaped or sized bone on x ray or markedly raised ALP blood test.\n\n- The affected bone may feel warmer than other bones upon palpation due to increased blood flow.  When the femur or tibia are affected, bowing can occur. The condition tends to begin proximally and progress to affect the distal part of the bone also.\n\n- Patients can present with bony deformities, such as enlargement in their skull leading to the classic textbook presentation of a patient whose hat no longer fits.If symptomatic, patients may complain of a deep, boring, pain over the affected bones although this tends to be a late symptom.\n\n- The condition may be complicated by pathological fractures due to the bone being weakened by the chaotic remodelling process. They are often transverse fractures.\n\n- Adjacent joints can develop painful osteoarthritis and spine enlargement can cause spinal stenosis.\n\n- Skull enlargement can lead to complications such as hearing loss (most commonly), thought to be due to cochlear damage. They may also develop tinnitus because of nerve compression.\n\n- Rarely patients can develop osteosarcoma which might be suspected if their pain levels suddenly and significantly worsens.\n\n- From a cardiac perspective, patients are more likely to develop congestive heart failure, particularly if more than 40% of their skeleton is affected by the condition.\n\n**Summary of Complications of Paget's disease**\n\n- Disruption of anatomy:\n  - Pain\n  - Deformity and fractures\n  - Hearing loss (caused by vestibulocochlear nerve compression or ossicle ossification)\n  - Spinal stenosis\n  - Osteoarthritis\n  - Nerve compression\n- Effects of abnormal metabolism:\n  - Osteosarcoma (<1%)\n  - High output heart failure\n\n**Investigations in Paget's Disease**\n\nThe first step to diagnose Paget's is to request x rays of the suspected affected bones. An early finding is osteolysis and later in the condition, increased bone size and sclerosis may be seen.\n\nWhen fractures occur in patients with Paget's, the fracture tends to have a pathological appearance, for example osteolytic lesions may be seen.\n\nIn addition to x rays, liver function tests should be requested and particularly ALP which is significantly raised. The increase in ALP is due to bone resorption and levels correlate with how widespread the condition is.\n\nCalcium and phosphate levels are usually normal.\n\n**Management of Paget's Disease**\n\nTreatment for Paget's disease is with analgesia and bisphosphonates such as alendronic acid or pamidronic acid.  \n\nBisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity and reduce progression of the condition.\n\nTreatment can normalise ALP levels and even heal lytic lesions and normalise bone structures.\n\nComplications from Paget's such as deafness are unlikely to be helped by the therapy.\n\nA typical duration of therapy is 6 months and following completion, bone activity may return to normal.\n\nThere is a risk of recurrence and biochemical markers should be monitored at regular 6 or 12 month intervals.\n\nDisease activity is measured by monitoring **ALP**."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd2e3", "topic": "Clinical Chemistry", "concept": "Derangements of albumin", "explanation": "Albumin is a protein that is produced in the liver and is involved in transporting various compounds in the blood.\n\nLow albumin levels are due to a deficiency in production or excessive excretion.\n\nDeficiency albumin production may be because of inadequate oral intake or malabsorption or due to liver disease.

Investigation of osteoporosis involves the confirmation of osteoporosis and the exclusion of other metabolic bone disease:\n\n**Confirming osteoporosis:**\n\n* DEXA scan (Gold standard)\n* X-rays (wrist, heel, spine, hip) if fractures suspected\n* MRI spine (to look for vertebral fracture)\n\n\n**Exclude metabolic bone disease if necessary:**\n\n* Bone profile (calcium, phosphate, albumin, total protein, ALP)\n* Vitamin D level\n* TFTs\n* Urinary free cortisol\n* Testosterone\n* Bence-Jones protein\n\n**Interpretation of DEXA scans**\n\nIf patients are at risk of developing osteoporosis, they should be assessed using a scoring system such as QFracture or FRAX.\n\n- All women aged over 65 should be assessed and men aged over 75. Younger patients should be assessed if they have risk fractures e.g. a previous fragility fracture of frequent use of oral corticosteroids.\n\n- Depending on this score they may be offered a bone density scan of the spine and hip.\n\n- A score which shows a 10 year fracture risk of greater than 10% requires further assessment using a bone density scan.\n\n- T-scores compare the patient's bone density with that of a young patient of the same gender. A score of 0 is average. A positive or negative score indicates how many standard deviations away from the mean the patient's bone density is.\n\n- Osteoporosis is diagnosed when patients have a T-score of less than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean. A score of between -1 and -2.5 indicates osteopenia.\n\n- The Z-score corrects the bone density score for age and sex. A score of less than 2 standard deviations from the mean indicates an abnormality that cannot be explained by aging but it is not used to formally diagnose osteoporosis.\n\n**Management of osteoporosis**\n\nManagement of osteoporosis is a combination of lifestyle change and pharmacoligal treatment:\n\n- Lifestyle changes:\n  - Reduce risk factors - e.g. stop smoking, better diabetic control,\n  - Better diet - adequate Vitamin D, calcium and protein\n  - Regular weight bearing exercise\n  - Hip protectors in nursing home patients\n- Pharmacological treatment:\n  - Vitamin D and calcium supplements - if in deficiency\n  - Bisphosphonates   \n  - Denosumab\n  - Raloxifene - used in postmenopausal women\n  - Hormone replacement therapy - used in women who have had a premature menopause\n\n  \n**Pharmacological management of Osteoporosis**\n\nBisphosphonates, raloxifene, hormone replacement therapy and denosumab act to reduce the rate of bone turnover by inhibiting osteoclasts.\n\n* Bisphosphonates are first line and tend to be given weekly. They are incorporated into osteoclast cells and interfere with cell function causing cells to be non-functional and apoptose. It is important that patients can tolerate sitting up for at least 30 minutes after the dose and also drink a glass of water with the dose to reduce the risk of developing an oesophageal ulcer.\n\n>Other side effects of bisphosphonates include atrial fibrillation, osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical stress fractures.\n\n* Raloxifene binds to oestrogen receptors and exerts the same protective action that oestrogen performs on bones by inhibiting osteoclastic action. For this reason, this medication, and hormone replacement therapy are useful in post-menopausal women.\n\n* Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody which inhibit receptors which, when activated lead to the maturation of osteoclasts.\n\n* Teriparatide (a parathyroid hormone) acts to stimulate bone growth.\n\n* Strontium ranelate both reduces the rate of bone turnover and also stimulates bone growth."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd2e8", "topic": "Clinical Chemistry", "concept": "Acute phase reactants", "explanation": "Acute phase reactants include a group of plasma proteins which increase or decrease in response to inflammation.\n\nThere are numerous acute phase reactants but only a few are routinely used in clinical practice.\n\nThe level of change in the plasma protein concentration correlates with the severity of the inflammatory stimulus and they will remain high or low until the inflammation has resolved.\n\nThe commonest acute phase reactants used in clinical practice are c-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen and ferritin.\n\nPlatelets also rise as part of the acute phase response to inflammation.

An example is systemic lupus erythematosus whereby ESR typically rises but CRP does not.\n\nESR is calculated by the rate at which red blood cells aggregate within one hour of testing. Physiologically, red blood cells are negatively charged and repel each other. In inflammatory processes, the rise in plasma proteins, particularly fibrinogen, which are positively charged disturbs this balance and results in faster red blood cell aggregation. ESR is particularly useful in monitoring rheumatological conditions including polymyalgia rheumatica and rheumatoid arthritis. ESR may remain elevated for up to a week beyond resolution of the inflammation.\n\nCRP is produced by the liver and acts to activate components of the complement system.

There may be low-grade pyrexia. Tachycardia may be the only presenting sign.\n\n- Note that a small pulmonary embolism may result in a normal examination.\n\n- A massive pulmonary embolism may present with hypotension, cyanosis, and signs of right heart strain (such as a raised JVP, parasternal heave, and loud P2).\n\nIt is important to look for signs of a concomitant deep vein thrombosis (a unilaterally swollen, tender calf). \n\n**Investigations:**\n\nBedside tests:\n\nECG: Normal or sinus tachycardia. In a massive PE there may be evidence of right-heart strain (with P pulmonale, right axis deviation, right bundle branch block, and non-specific ST/T wave changes). The classic S1Q3T3 (deep S waves in lead I, pathological Q waves in lead III, and inverted T waves in lead III) is relatively uncommon (<20% of patients).\n\nBlood tests:\n\nABG: This may be normal or show a type 1 respiratory failure (hypoxia without hypercapnia) and/or a respiratory alkalosis (due to hyperventilation secondary to hypoxia).\n\nRemember the baseline tests such as FBC (the patient may be anaemic if the PE has caused haemoptysis), CRP may be raised, U&E (to assess renal function before CTPA), clotting function (important if the patient is to be started on LMWH/Warfarin).\n\nSpecial tests include D-dimer (this is highly non-specific but has a 95% negative predictive value i.e. it is useful in ruling out a PE if negative). \n\nImaging investigations:\n\nChest x-ray: this is typically normal in PE but possible findings include *Fleischner sign* (an enlarged pulmonary artery), *Hampton's hump* (a peripheral wedge shaped opacity), and *Westermark's sign* (regional oligaemia). The chest x-ray is helpful in ruling out differentials (e.g. pneumonia, pneumothorax).\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA): this is the diagnostic test of choice for a PE and will show a filling defect in the pulmonary vasculature. Note that a V/Q scan is preferred if the patient has renal impairment, contrast allergy or is pregnant.\n\nLower limb Duplex: helpful if a DVT is thought to be the cause of the PE (note this investigation is first-line - before a CTPA - in pregnancy).\n\nBedside echocardiogram: this is used if the patient is thought to have a massive PE (signs of right heart strain/hypotension), in order to assess suitability for thrombolysis. \n\nWell's scoring system:\n\nThe Well's score is a useful tool for risk stratifying patients with a suspected PE.\n\nPoints are allocated as follows:\n\n- 3 points:\n  - Clinical signs and symptoms of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\n  - If no alternative diagnosis is more likely than a PE\n- 1.5 points:\n  - Tachycardia (heart rate >100 beats/minute)\n  - If the patient has been immobile for more than 3 days or has had major surgery within the last month\n  - If the patient has had a previous PE or DVT\n- 1 point:\n  - If the patient presents with haemoptysis\n  - If there is an active malignancy\n\nIf the Well's score is 4 or less the D-dimer should be measured. The D-dimer has a high negative predictive value but a low specificity so is only useful if the clinical suspicion of a PE is low.\n\nA low D-dimer excludes a PE. A raised D-dimer is an indication for diagnostic imaging (by CTPA or V/Q scan).\n\nIf the Well's score is more than 4 further diagnostic imaging is required. Low-molecular weight heparin is typically administered in the interim if the clinical suspicion of a PE is high (and should certainly be administered if there is delay in performing the CTPA). \n\n**Acute management:**\n\nIn the emergency department the patient should be assessed using the DR ABCDE approach:\n\n- Airway: likely to be patent.\n- Breathing: the patient may be tachypnoeic and hypoxic. Oxygen should be administered.\n- Circulation: the patient may be tachycardic. Signs of right heart strain are suggestive of a sub-massive PE. Hypotension is suggestive of a massive PE. Consider intravenous fluids if the systolic blood pressure is <90 mmHg.\n- Disability: likely to be unremarkable.\n- Exposure: the patient may have a low grade pyrexia. It is important to check for signs of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Consider analgesia at this stage if required.\n\nThrombolysis (an intravenous bolus of Alteplase) is indicated in a massive PE (features of haemodynamic instability). There is debate over whether it should be administered in a sub-massive PE.\n\n**Medical management:** \n\nAnticoagulation with treatment-dose LMWH should be administered.\n\nWarfarin should be initiated when the diagnosis is confirmed (target INR 2-3). LMWH should be continued for at least 5 days and until 48 hours of therapeutic INR (>2) has been achieved.\n\nThe duration of Warfarin treatment depends on the aetiology of the PE. A provoked PE (identifiable risk factors e.g. surgery, peri-partum) should be treated for 3 months. An unprovoked PE should be treated for 6 months. If there is an ongoing cause (e.g. a thrombophilia) the patient should be treated for life.\n\nRecurrence of a VTE in a patient already on warfarin requires an increase in the target INR (to 3-4).\n\n**Interventional management:**\n\nEmbolectomy may be considered in patients with a massive PE when thrombolysis is contraindicated.\n\nAn inferior vena cava filter may be considered in patients with recurrent DVTs on Warfarin or patients in which anticoagulation is contraindicated."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd2f5", "topic": "Respiratory", "concept": "Pleural effusion", "explanation": "A pleural effusion is the abnormal buildup of fluid in the pleural cavity. It has many causes, and treatment aims at relieving associated respiratory distress, as well as tackling the underlying cause.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPleural effusions may have variable presentations due to the many conditions which can cause them, but general symptoms relating to the effusion itself include:\n\n- Dyspnoea \n- Reduced exercise tolerance\n- Chest pain\n\n**Signs**\n\nGeneral inspection: the patient may be in respiratory distress and tachypnoeic.\n\nOn examination of the chest:\n\n- The trachea is central or deviated away from the affected side (if large).\n- Chest expansion is reduced on the affected side.\n- The percussion note is stoney dull on the affected side.\n- On auscultation there are reduced/absent breath sounds over the effusion. There may be bronchial breathing at the upper border of the pleural effusion.\n- Vocal resonance/tactile vocal fremitus is reduced over the effusion.\n\nWhilst examining the patient it is also important to look for underlying clues as to the aetiology of the effusion, such as: pyrexia (suggestive of infection), cachexia and clubbing (suggestive of malignancy), raised JVP and ankle oedema (suggestive of heart failure).\n\n**Causes:**\n\nCauses of pleural effusions are mainly divided into exudative (protein content >35 g/L) and transudative (protein content <35 g/L):\n\nExudative pleural effusions are caused by diseases which increase capillary permeability, including:\n\n- Infections such as pneumonia or TB.\n- Malignancy such as bronchial carcinoma, mesothelioma, or lung metastases.\n- Inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or acute pancreatitis.\n- Pulmonary infarct (for example secondary to a pulmonary embolism) and trauma.\n\nTransudative pleural effusions are caused by imbalances in the Starling forces that govern the formation of interstitial fluid.\n\n- Conditions that increase the capillary hydrostatic pressure (forcing fluid out of the pulmonary capillaries into the pleural space) include congestive cardiac failure.\n- Conditions that reduce the capillary oncotic pressure (impairing the reabsorption of fluid from the pleural space into the pulmonary capillaries) include cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome/chronic kidney disease, and gastrointestinal malabsorption/malnutrition (eg. Coeliac disease). \n\nLess common causes of transudative pleural effusions include hypothyroidism and Meig's syndrome (described by the triad of ascites, pleural effusion, and benign ovarian tumour).\n\nNote: transudative pleural effusions are more likely to be bilateral, whilst exudative pleural effusions are more likely to be unilateral.\n\n**Investigations**\n\nBlood tests\n\nRoutine blood tests should be performed as this will help identify the underlying cause. For example, the FBC may show a raised white cell count suggestive of infection, U&E may show a raised creatinine suggestive of renal impairment, LFTs may show a low albumin and raised ALT/AST suggestive of cirrhosis.\n\nImaging\n\nA chest x-ray is the first-line imaging investigation in all patients with a suspected pleural effusion. Chest x-ray will reveal blunting of the costophrenic angle or white out of one hemifield (if large).\n\nPleural fluid analysis\n\nDiagnostic ultrasound-guided thoracentesis for pleural fluid analysis is required in all patients except those with clear evidence of heart failure (such as raised jugular venous pressure, pitting ankle oedema, and signs on chest x-ray).\n\nThe pleural fluid should be sent for biochemistry (protein level, LDH, glucose, pH, amylase), cytology, microbiology, and immunology. As previously explained, exudative pleural effusions are those with a protein content of >35 g/L and transudative pleural effusions are those with a protein content of <35 g/L.\n\nHowever, if the protein content is equivocal (25-35 g/L), Light's criteria can be applied:\n\n- This states that an effusion is an exudate if: the pleural fluid to serum protein ratio is >0.5, the pleural fluid to serum LDH ratio is >0.6, or the pleural fluid LDH is >2/3 the upper reference limit for serum LDH. \n\nOther measured parameters may also aid the diagnosis:\n\n- Glucose: low in rheumatoid arthritis, TB, or malignancy\n\n- pH: <7.2 in empyema \n\n- Amylase: raised in pancreatitis\n\n- Immunology: rheumatoid factor is useful if rheumatoid arthritis is suspected; anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) is useful if systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is suspected; complement is typically low in pleural effusions caused by rheumatoid arthritis or SLE.\n\n**Management**\n\nThe underlying cause should be treated and the patient should be managed in an ABCDE approach, including appropriate oxygen therapy and attempts to reduce respiratory distress medically (eg. diuretics for heart failure or antibiotics for chest infections). Ultrasound-guided pleural aspiration is indicated if this fails or the patient remains symptomatic from the pleural effusion.\n\nOther management options to be considered include:\n\n- An intercostal drain: for large pleural effusions or empyemas (pus in the pleural space).\n\n- For recurrent or persistent pleural effusions: pleurodesis (obliteration of the pleural space) may be considered. Pleurodesis can be chemical (with use of a sclerosing agent e.g. tetracycline or bleomycin) or surgical (via thoracotomy or thoracoscopy)."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd2f6", "topic": "Respiratory", "concept": "Haemopytsis differentials", "explanation": "The main differential diagnoses for haemoptysis can be divided into the following categories:\n\n**Vascular**\n\n**Pulmonary Embolism:** Patients present with acute dyspnoea, pleurisy, haemoptysis and syncope.

This leads to fluid and blood cells leaking into the alveoli. The infection spreads across the alveoli and eventually the lung tissue becomes consolidated, impairing the gas exchange due to reduced ventilation. The most common type of pneumonia is caused by streptococcus pneumonia, which is generally community-acquired, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. \n\n**Symptoms** \n\n- Fever\n- Malaise\n- Rigors\n- Cough\n- Purulent sputum\n- Pleuritic chest pain\n- Haemoptysis\n\n**Signs** \n\n- Tachypnoea\n- Tachycardia\n- Hypotension\n- Cyanosis\n- Pyrexia\n- Dull percussion\n- Increased vocal resonance/ tactile vocal fremitus\n- Bronchial breathing - this is a higher pitch and inspiration and expiration are equal. There is an audible pause between inspiration and expiration.\n- Pleural rub is an audible sound heard in patients with pleurisy. It is caused by the layers of pleura rubbing against each other. \n\n**Features of specific pneumonias** \n\n- **Hospital-acquired pneumonia:** this is a lower respiratory tract infection that develops more than 48 hours after hospital admission. The most common organisms are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcal aureus, and Enterobacteria. \n- **Aspiration pneumonia** this occurs in patients with an unsafe swallow. Risk factors include stroke, myasthenia gravis, bulbar palsy, alcoholism, and achalasia. On chest x-ray the right lung is most commonly affected, as the right bronchus is wider and more vertical than the left bronchus, making it more likely to facilitate the passage of aspirate. \n- **Staphylococcal pneumonia:** a bilateral cavitating bronchopneumonia due to staphylococcal aureus, a gram-positive cocci found in clusters. It is found in intravenous drug users, elderly patients, or patients who already have an influenza infection.\n- **Klebsiella pneumonia:** primarily affects the upper lobes resulting in a cavitating pneumonia, presenting with *\u201cred-currant\u201d* sputum. It is caused by a gram-negative anaerobic rod. Furthermore, there is an increased risk of developing complications including empyema, lung abscesses and pleural adhesions. Patients at risk of Klebsiella pneumonia are those with weakened immune systems such as elderly, alcoholics, and diabetics. Additional at-risk groups include patients with malignancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, long term steroid use and renal failure.\n- **Mycoplasma pneumonia:** presents with flu like symptoms consisting of flu, arthralgia, myalgia, dry cough and headache. It primarily affects younger patients. Additional features include auto-immune manifestation due to cold agglutinins causing an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Complications that are associated with this pneumonia include: erythema multiforme; Stevens-Johnson Syndrome; Guillain-Barre Syndrome and meningoencephalitis.\n- **Legionella pneumonia:** fever, myalgia and malaise followed by a dyspnoea and a dry cough. It is associated with Legionnaire's disease, usually in patients who have been exposed to poor hotel air conditioning.\n- **Chlamydophila psittaci pneumonia:** Chlamydophila psittaci is an intracellular bacteria that results in psittacosis. It is acquired from contact with infected birds such as parrots, cattle, horse and sheep. Features include lethargy, arthralgia, headache, anorexia, dry cough and fever. Additional features include: hepatitis; splenomegaly; nephritis; infective endocarditis; meningoencephalitis and a rash. \n- **Pneumocystis pneumonia:** is associated with patients who are immunosuppressed (malignancy or chemotherapy) or HIV positive. The causative organism is known as pneumocystis jiroveci and is a fungus. In patients who are HIV-positive the risk of PCP increases when the CD4+ <200 cells/uL. Symptoms include exertional dyspnoea, dry cough, and fever.\n\n**Investigations** \n\n- ABG\n- Bloods \u2013 FBC, U&E, LFT, ESR, CRP\n- Blood culture\n- Sputum for microscopy & culture\n- Polymerase chain reaction: for mycoplasma pneumonia \n- Urine antigen: for legionella and pneumococcal pneumonia \n- Chest X-ray: identify lobar, multi-lobar, cavitation and signs of pleural effusion\n\n**Management** \n\nCURB-65 is a scoring system used for community-acquired pneumonia.

Paracetamol 1g/6 hours (Max. 4g 24hours)\n\n- Antibiotics can be given orally for patients who are not nil by mouth and are managed in the community. However, for severe pneumonia Intravenous route is required.\n\n- Follow up appointments are organized for 6 weeks and CXR could be repeated at this time if there are complications or symptoms have not resolved. \n\nPlease note that specific pneumonias have specific antibiotic requirements.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe pneumococcal vaccine protects against Streptococcus pneumoniae. There are two types of this vaccine either the conjugate or the polysaccharide vaccine. The polysaccharide vaccine covers a greater number of serotypes and is more commonly used in comparison the conjugate vaccine.\n\nPneumococcal vaccine is routinely offered as three injections at the age of 2 months, 4 months and 12-13 months.\n\nPeople aged 65 years and older and those in at-risk groups should be offered the pneumococcal vaccine.\n\nAt-risk groups include chronic heart, liver or renal conditions. These include liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, post-transplant and renal failure. Additionally, patients who are immuno-suppressed due to AIDS or chemotherapy; or have decreased spleen function due to splenectomy, asplenia or sickle cell disease qualify for this group. Furthermore, patients with chronic lung conditions such as COPD or bronchiectasis would be applicable.\n\nSome patients within the at-risk group require a vaccination every 5 years.

Poor absorption through destroyed villi in the small bowel also leads to weight loss, muscle wasting and failure to thrive.\n\n- The gold standard for diagnosis of coeliac disease is small bowel biopsy. Immune destruction of small bowel villi leads to diagnostic biopsy findings of villous atrophy (as enterocytes forming the tips of villi are destroyed), crypt hyperplasia (basal cells rapidly divide to try to compensate for distal villi cell destruction) and increased epithelial lymphocytes. Serological markers of anti-tissue transglutaminase, anti-endomysial and antigliadin autoantibodies can also contribute towards the diagnosis, but are not as sensitive or specific as biopsy.\n\n- Management of coeliac disease is through a diet excluding gluten, which is in wheat, rye, barley and some oats (oats themselves do not contain gluten, but are often contaminated with gluten during processing).

Constipation is generally defined as a child that defecates less than 3 times per week or significant difficulty passing stool. The most common cause is chronic constipation, although it can be a sign of an underlying condition like Hirschsprung's disease.  \n\n- Chronic constipation in children is associated with hard pellet like stool that is difficult to pass.\n\n- There are many factors in why children might become constipated. Firstly, they might have a diet low in fibre. Secondly, they might not like going to the toilet and so hold the stool. For example, they might associate going for a poo with pain, if the stool is hard to pass and/or if it has caused an anal fissure. Thirdly, they might not recognise the sensation of needing to go for a poo, particularly if the child is late to be toilet trained. As stool builds up in the rectum, the bowel wall will distend past the point that stretch receptors detect the stretch. This means that the sensation of needing to go will be lost. Children may involuntarily defecate into their pants as the anus spontaneously opens from the full rectum. There may also be overflow diarrhoea from fluid moving past the hard stool in the rectum.\n\n- Chronic constipation is diagnosed from history and palpation of impacted faeces (hard depressible masses) on abdominal examination. An abdominal ultrasound can also be helpful if the examination is not clear.\n\n- Treatment of chronic constipation is with a movicol disimpaction regimen, followed by maintenance movicol, in tandem with a high fibre diet and parenting advice about encouraging good toilet habits.  \n\n**Hirschsprung's disease** is a specific example which causes chronic constipation. As the baby develops in utero, the distal colon is not innervated correctly. The resulting aganglionic colon is shrunken and not able to distend properly. This causes a back pressure of stool trapped in the more proximal colon.\n\n- Hirschsprung's disease can present at birth with a delay in passing meconium (>48 hours). A classic story is a baby with a distended abdomen where after digital rectal examination there is a forceful evacuation of meconium on removal of the digit. It is also common for children with this condition to present later in childhood with a chronic history of constipation with poor response to movicol disimpaction regimens and poor weight gain.\n\n- A history and examination (digital rectal examination) suspicious for Hirschsprung's can be confirmed with a rectal suction biopsy.\n\n- Definitive management of Hirschsprung's disease is through removal of the section of aganglionic colon."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd35f", "topic": "Paediatrics", "concept": "Complications of trisomy syndromes", "explanation": "There are 3 major trisomy disorders that produce viable fetuses: trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome).

In infants, chest compressions should be performed with both thumbs, whereas in children aged over 1 year, chest compressions should be performed with the heel of one hand, or both hands with fingers interlocked for larger children.\n\nResuscitation should be continued until:\n\n* Child shows signs of life.\n* Further help arrives.\n* Rescuer becomes exhausted."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd38b", "topic": "Paediatrics", "concept": "Diabetic ketoacidosis", "explanation": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a medical emergency thatis characterised by hyperglycaemia, acidosis and ketonaemia.\n\nSpecific values to make the diagnosis:  \n\n* Ketonaemia: 3mmol/L and over\n* Blood glucose over 11mmol/L\n* Bicarbonate below 15mmol/L or venous pH less than 7.3\n\nNB: Hyperglycaemia may not always be present.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis can be precipitated by several causes, such as infection, dehydration, fasting, or the first presentation of Type 1 diabetes. \n\nOne important point is that fever is not part of DKA presentation; if the patient presents with a raised temperature, this could indicate an underlying infection that might have triggered DKA.\n\nDKA should be recognised from clinical features and confirmed with a blood glucose measurement (hyperglycaemia) and a blood gas sample (metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation). \n\n**Clinical features**\n\nSmell of acetone, vomiting, dehydration, abdominal pain, hyperventilation (Kussmaul; deep sighing), hypovolaemic shock, drowsiness, coma \n\n**Essential early investigations**\n\n* Blood glucose (>11.1mmol/L)\n* Blood ketones (>3mmol/L)\n* Urea and eletrolytes\n* Blood gas analysis\n* Urinary glucose and ketones\n* Blood cultures (if evidence of infection)\n* Cardiac monitoring/ECG (any ischaemic changes or changes secondary to hypokalaemia)\n\n\nInitial management depends on the clinical presentation:\n\n* If patient is alert, not significantly dehydrated and able to tolerate oral intake without vomiting --> encourage oral intake and give subcutaneous insulin injection\n* If patient is vomiting, confused, or significantly dehydrated --> give IV fluids (initial bolus of 10mls/kg 0.9% NaCl then discuss with senior) and insulin infusion at 0.1 units/kg/hour 1hr after starting IV fluids.\n* If patient is shocked or comatose --> ABCDE approach for emergency resuscitation\n\nAn excellent summary of DKA management as a flowchart (page 22) can be found [here.](https://www.bsped.org.uk/media/1745/bsped-dka-guidelines-no-dka-link.pdf)\n\n**Re-establishing subcutaneous insulin**\n\nDo not stop intravenous insulin infusion until **1 hour after** subcutaneous insulin has been given.\n\n**Cerebral oedema**\n\nThe major complication of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is **cerebral oedema**. It is rare, but can occur hours after the onset of DKA.\n\nThe mechanism for cerebral oedema in DKA is not fully understood. \n\nOne theory is that it results from rapid correction of dehydration with IV fluids. The theory is that if the blood is initially very concentrated, with corresponding high salt levels (hypernatremia) and is rapidly diluted with IV fluids (to hyponatremia) then osmotic shifts will occur. \n\nWater will move from the blood into the tissues, which in the brain causes swelling of structures in an enclosed space (the skull). Swelling of the brain causes rapid deterioration, coma, and can be fatal. \n\nHowever, this theory is not the full mechanism because it is a rare complication of DKA occurring in about 1% of patients, although all patients receive fluid management. Regardless, this is the reason that correction of fluid deficit is recommended to be undertaken slowly in DKA, over 48 hours."}, {"_id": "5f2c0daa5f60619fe21dd38c", "topic": "Paediatrics", "concept": "Type 1 diabetes", "explanation": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system targets and destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. The underlying cause of this autoimmune condition is thought to be a combination of genetics (higher rates with family history of T1DM and other autoimmune disease) and environmental triggers (e.g. certain viral infections) but is not fully understood.\n\n- As the body's production of insulin gradually decreases, children start to exhibit characteristic signs of polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss. As the condition progresses and insulin production grinds to a total halt, a complete lack of insulin can precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). As a result, about 10% of cases of T1DM are first diagnosed when these children present acutely with DKA.\n\n- The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is made through raised blood glucose measurements (random BM > 11.0 mmol/L), along with other markers like raised HbA1c, urine ketones and raised fasting glucose (>7.0 mmol/L).\n\n\n- Definitive management of type 1 diabetes is through insulin replacement with a personalised regimen of short-acting (after meals and snacks) and long-term (at night) insulin replacement therapy. Insulin can be delivered through subcutaneous injections with a pen device, or with a continuous automatic infusion pump in older children.\n\n- Immediately after diagnosis, insulin requirements may be very low if the pancreas is still able to produce a significant amount of insulin. This is known as the 'honeymoon period'. It is important that children are closely monitored during this time. This is because insulin requirements can suddenly increase as the remaining beta cells are destroyed. Additionally, as the blood glucose may be normal in this period on very low insulin doses, parents may incorrectly think that the condition has gone away.\n\n- Overall, T1DM is a complex condition that requires a multidisciplinary team approach. It is essential to make sure the family, patient and school are educated and engaged with monitoring diet, glucose levels and insulin therapy in this lifelong condition. Consistent adherence to a personalised plan will help avoid complications of diabetes, both in the short term (diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoglycaemia) and long term (renal, cardiovascular and retinal disease).\n\nHypoglycaemia presents with irritability, abdominal pain, sweating, dizziness, loss of consciousness and even fits. It should be managed according to the condition of the child.\n\n- If the hypoglycaemic child is alert, sugary drinks, gels and snacks should be encouraged. If unconscious and out of hospital, intramuscular glucagon should be given. In hospital, an unconscious child should be started on intravenous dextrose.\n\n**Complications and associations**\n\n- Growth and pubertal development (delay in puberty and obesity)\n- Hypertension\n- Renal disease\n- Retinopathy\n- Feet\n- Associated illnesses:\n  - Thyroid disease (most associated; screening recommended)\n  - Coeliac disease"}]
